18,tea,"Hi!Long time tea fan, now getting into more interesting / premium stuff. 1) I have some some excellent loose leaf tea I got with a gaiwan, so naturally I want to brew it gong-fu style. Problem is that some of them have a recommendation of using amounts of water that are more than the gaiwan can hold. To get the best results, should I scale down water + tea amount proportionally, or is it better to use the recommended water + tea amounts with a bigger cup and don't use the gaiwan?2) I have some mate (not a tea, but still). I don't have a filtered straw, or the special glass for it. The packaging recommends brewing it western style, for like 5 minutes, but reading online thats not at all how its usually drank. Worth buying a kit for it or is it pretty close already? I really like it so far. 3) What do I do if I'm drinking a loose leaf tea that can do 12 or even more infusions, but I don't have time to drink them all, or can't share it with others? Can I just put it away, and use it the next day? Feels like being wet could cause it to become worse maybe. Store in fridge/just leave it outside/let it dry, but cover it/...?Maybe I'm just overthinking it haha. Thanks for any help üçµ",A couple questions I didn't find answers to in the wiki

32,tea,"I recently wrote about shifts in consumer preference related to sheng pu'er, about style and pricing changes.  This continues from that, exploring if there is an inexpensive way to have related experience, that doesn't involve spending $80 to 100 on higher quality, natural arbor sourced sheng versions (or $50 for something presented as of more modest quality, or at least better value).  These are ""factory teas,"" less expensive and different versions / style, with tuocha a reference to the shape, compressed into a ball, or bird's nest shape really.  They don't cost much; I just saw a newer Dayi / Taetea version listed for $6 (for 100 grams), and finding somewhat aged versions for around $10-15 isn't so unusual.  Not truly aged though, which are in higher demand.  This style of tea transitions to a warmer, milder, more complex flavor and character range after about 15 years, and bitterness and astringency switch over to other flavor and feel.

I'm buying from a second hand store that sells it at the same price but has less variations. Tea sachets always confused me and I'm not sure if I'm making them wrong, I'd pick their loose leaf anytime because it's much easier to measure.

He would like to start laying off the Coke Zero (and Cherry Coke Zero &amp; no sugar Dr. Pepper, ect). I've told him I will gladly make him tea (probably iced tea?) to replace the soda, but now we need to find an acceptable replacement. It needs to be caffeinated. Also, he likes things on the sweeter side (I'm sure we can work down from there, but starting off too bitter will probably be a turn-off &amp; I'd like for this to be successful for him.) I've been buying loose leaf teas for years &amp; years so he's seen me drinking my happy green tea every day. He'd just like to see if I can help him find some types that he would like.I am at a loss as to how to even begin to find something that has a chance of replacing the soda.

206,tea,"I‚Äôve been a part of this sub for quite a while. Two things I see posted again and again are ‚Äúwhere can I buy real Yixing?‚Äù And ‚ÄúIs this pot I got second hand real Yixing‚Äù. This post is an attempt to answer both of those as well clarify a lot of misconception about the craft in general. I spend most of my day authenticating and translating teapot seals and every summer I visit (not recently obviously) Dingshu town in Yixing China where the local artisans live and sell prefired pots. I feel I‚Äôm pretty knowledgeable. First some clarification. Yixing teapot refers extremely specifically to teapots constructed in a slab built (not thrown on a pottery wheel) method and of ore mined in and around the town of Yixing. This started with HuangLongShan mine and has expanded to others, then the government ceased mining operations at most sights. Pots are either fully hand made or half handmade. The names associated with this clay are ZiSha or ZiNi aka purple sand. There are many sub categories and specific types of clay such as DaHongNi but this is unimportant. Teapots made of other clay are not Yixing. Teapots that are injection mold slip casted are not Yixing. These pots will often have the name Yixing China stamped on the bottom though. This brings me to Yixing rule number one: If you bought a pot for less than 100USD. It‚Äôs not real sorry. This is the entry for half handmade pots. Fully handmade shoots that price up. Artist renown shoots it up more. You will not get Yixing for less than 100USD. Period. And those fancy sets with all the cups and poem on the box, those are the worst. Rule number two: if it doesn‚Äôt have a seal stamped on the bottom it‚Äôs not Yixing. The government controls pottery and works of registered artists are required to be stamped and their stamps are catalogued. If it just has a name carved into it or nothing it‚Äôs probably made in Taiwan or a fake cashgrab. Rule number three: if the pot is super ornate with carvings or nature scenes molded into it and you didn‚Äôt pay a hefty sum, it‚Äôs slip casted injection molded clay and fake.So where can I get real Yixing? ‚ÄîAre you interested in function and want the best clay for enhancing tea without regard to it being ‚Äúart‚Äù or one of a kind?You want a vintage government backed factory pot. Ideally out of factory one during the 70s and 80s. Half handmade and have some liberties taken with craftsmanship but made of the best clay that is now no longer available.  is the best for this. There are some others like ‚ÄúauthenticYixing‚Äù but I personally trust this seller. ‚ÄîDo you not care so much about vintage or one of a kind and would like a modern pot centered in functionality made of authentic (but not factory one) clay?Mud and leaves is the place to go they work with Chen Chunhong and his wife to ship in their half handmade pots. Good price, interviews with the craftsman, great craftsmanship.‚Äî Do you want a work of art?For modern but adhering to traditional standards and fully hand made on of a kind  is the place. They video call with the nationally recognized and ranked craftsmen and have everything from rising apprentice works to master level potters. For modern and not adhering to traditional standards and form Yinchen studio is great. They offer some half and some fully handmade but they break a lot of rules in regard to teapot form and are like the modern art side of Yixing. Vintage fully handmade‚Ä¶ sorry these are ridiculously expensive or on display in the national museum of Chinese art.Now there are certainly other places to buy. I would strongly avoided these unless you are into the hobby and have done a good bit of research into authentication. The problem is that every other shop (Yunnan sourcing and the likes) don‚Äôt post the artist, clay type, or production method of their available pots. All the places mentioned above do, most having video interviews or videos of pots being made as well. Any further questions ask away!",A guide to Yixing teapots and where to buy

I have enjoyed tea at tea houses and occasionally iced tea in the past. So far, though, I feel really frustrated with how weak it is coming out. I'm using about 3 times as much tea as the retailer recommends, steeping for the max recommended time, and heating water to the recommended temperature. The teas are all... nice, I guess, but they mostly taste to me like hot water with a little bit of other flavors - and very few of those flavors are what I think of as that quintessential black tea flavor.The retailer recommends one teaspoon ""per cup"" (which I understand typically means 6 ounces in the tea world). I have a 20 ounce teapot, so I'm using 2 tablespoons, AKA 6 teaspoons. That amount expands to fill the infuser basket most or all of the way.I've also tried adding a very small amount of sugar, but that does nothing to bring out any flavor (just makes it slightly sweet).***Am I just not cut out for tea?

The taste of tea was always.. ok-ish. Could sense different notes of flavour, no chlorine taste or smell was present, overall nice experience.Though when I drank tea in my local teashop the difference was always there. Talking about same tea cultivars from same year tasted there and in home, as they also sell the tea leaves they serve to guests. Teashop tea was always more reach and balanced. Always. I thought that they have some great know-how, since they are business. Well... turns out it probably was just water all along.I used bottled mineral water, all other factors seemed the same to me.

485,tea,"I'm looking to up my tea game by getting a nice cast iron teapot and I'm curious how having a teapot changes the experience, flavor, etc vs brewing a single cup of tea.I'm most interested in cast iron, partially because I'm clumsy, i like their aesthetic more than glass or ceramic, and partially because I'm a cast iron fan for everything.Are there any recommended brands? I would love one that the spout can actually pour a clean flow of water, and one that can hold 3-4 cups of tea (about 30 FL oz or 700-800 mL). Price point $100, but preferably $50. If possible having one not from Amazon would be great.If you have something similar do you use it regularly or for special occasions? Do you have to brew only certain kinds of tea in it? I normally change the type of tea i have each day (black, oolong, puer, green varieties), is that alright in this type of pot? Are they too heavy to use a lot? Thanks!",curious about teapots

I'm wondering if anybody has any solid data on caffeine content in tea? I'm mostly interested in green teas, as those are my daily drinkers, but I do have the occasional black, white or oolong, so any information is appreciated. My partner and I are currently trying to get pregnant, and high caffeine consumption is linked to lower conception rates. Of course, once pregnant, caffeine is supposed to be limited to about 200mg/day, too. I'm trying to figure out if my daily intake is acceptable under that upper limit, or if I should be reducing/looking for lower caffeine varieties.I currently drink 4 cups of tea/day, typically gyokuro or sencha asamushi, so those are my biggest concerns. At other times, I drink a korean semi-wild green, or (Taiwainese) pi lo chun. Sometimes one cup of silver needle (white), or a chinese black (pu'er or yunnan), so bonus points for information on those. I use one serving of tea leaves for 3 or 4 steeps; if only 3, then I'll have an additional cup with fresh leaves.

542,tea,"I got my second shipment of Bird &amp; Blend teas this week and have been quite amazingly impressed with every flavour.In my first shipment I liked the teas, but none of them really wowed me. Peach Cobbler was too subtly flavoured/not very peachy, Cherry Bakewell was a bit tangy cherry, not much else, Dark Choc Chilli Chai was okay but didn't blow me away, Totally Nutty was quite good, but Bonfire Toffee (which I think is a great tea) just didn't somehow suit my tastebuds.This time I got the following four teas:* **Creme Egg Tea** - *Sri Lankan black tea, cocoa nibs, cocoa shells, jasmine blossom, sunflower petals, natural flavouring* - a really incredible tea that tastes like chocolate custard but is not remotely ""sickly"" or artificial, as many chocolate-flavoured teas can be. The jasmine is very subtle, I couldn't markedly detect it, but I feel it gives a slight floral hint/lift. As an experiment I brewed a cup adding a tiny bit of jasmine tea, and the extra jasmine actually didn't work, so I think they've got the balance perfect.* **Birthday Cake** - *Rooibos (84%), Sri Lankan Black Tea, Sprinkles, Almond Pieces, Vanilla Pieces, Mallow Flowers, natural flavouring* - I'm not a huge fan of rooibos generally, but the almond in this really brings it together and it's an exceptionally smooth cup and much like Yorkshire Biscuit Tea, is somehow ""savoury"" rather than sweet.* **The Big Smoke** - *Chinese pu'er tea, ginger, lemongrass, lapsang souchong black tea, red peppercorns* - honestly one of the most fascinating and drinkable flavoured teas I've had. It's like a savoury smoky lemon chai. I will almost certainly be ordering this one again, as well as looking for similar blends.* **Coconut Milk Oolong** - *Taiwanese milk oolong, coconut flakes, desiccated coconut* - this one is supposed to be brewed at 80c and the first time I made it I brewed it too hot, not letting the boiled water cool enough. This made it taste like bitter green tea not even an oolong. The second time I put some cold water in the cup first and the transformation was amazing. It's so smooth. I even managed to drink a cup of it without milk and didn't hugely struggle as I usually do with black/non-milk-added tea. The only thing I wonder about is whether the coconut could be a bit stronger? So I'm going to try adding some extra coconut to a future cup to see what that does.","Review of four Bird &amp; Blend teas: Creme Egg, Birthday Cake, The Big Smoke, Coconut Milk Oolong"

547,tea,"I just watched the first episode of True Believers (S1:E1 Empire of Yoga), a Vice series on cults, on HULU. The episode talked about Yogi Bhajan (Harbhajan Singh Khalsa) who came from India in the 60s and set up a big cult called [3HO]( Yogi Tea is one of the corporate entities of 3HO.Yogi Bhajan encouraged his followers to move in together and form Ashrams. They were encouraged to buy houses and put them in the cult‚Äôs name. They were encouraged to work for the cult and to send their children to boarding schools 3HO set up in India. Some of the women have come out and said that they were sexually abused by Yogi Bhajan (he died in 2004, and his family now owns Yogi Tea and continues the cult). The children at the boarding schools were beaten regularly and went through a lot at the schools. While the Yogi‚Äôs family got rich, a lot of the supporters were very poor, living in squalor, and working for the cult.I just thought Yogi tea was just one of the multiple regular tea companies on the market.

I'm using tea leaves (not bags) in a cup that is made to prepare to infuse the tea, but it prevents me from making more of it or even transferring it to another recipient. So I assume that I need a kettle and something to boil the water (maybe a 2 in one?). What do you recommend in that regard?

Apparently by sometime in 2019'ish the professionals in the industry saw that the excitement of ""Jin Jun Mei"" had passed, and the market was littered with fakes \[which may have actually been serious attempts to produce a better JJM, but who could actually claim ""authenticity"" in the origin of it and process?\]. see  [  and [  and [Nonetheless despite the intrigue and manipulation the tea I'm recommending here, whatever it might be properly called, is outstanding as a true, robust, dark, rich, complex, delicious, cup for those that like dark, somewhat 'heavy', never-disappoints black.

1215,tea,"**Tea colors**The botanical name for tea is Camellia sinensis, which comes from the family Camellia. This is the Chinese variety; in the northeast of India, a second variety known as Camellia assamica was discovered in the nineteenth century. The tea bush has leaves with finely serrated edges, with numerous oil glands. The flowers are white and have a delicate fragrance.&amp;#x200B;[ Tea Colours](The cultivation of tea requires a warm, humid climate, and cultivation at higher altitudes is considered to produce tea of superior quality, although factors such as the climate, soil, method of harvest, and processing also affect the tea quality.The majority of teas are made from young leaves. When the bush reaches the necessary maturity, leaves are picked by hand. For the highest quality teas, only the top three newest leaves are picked.After harvesting comes to the drying process. The leaves are spread out and left to wilt until they are very malleable and can be rolled without breaking. During this process is when the leaves release the substances that give them their characteristic color and smell.**The giant forest**In 1939, in the province of Yunnan in the southeast of China, a huge swath of wild tea trees were discovered. Some were more than 98 feet (30 meters) high with trunks 3 feet (a meter) in diameter. Their age is estimated to be around 1,700 years old.**Modern and classic teas**The custom of delicately flavored teas has been around for many years; however, fruity teas are a more recent trend and are often closer to an herbal infusion. The ideal choice is always a tea with a truly natural aroma and essence, such as those shown on these pages.**Green tea**&amp;#x200B;[Green tea]( is made by drying the leaves completely to avoid fermentation. It is the most common tea consumed in China and Japan. Along with white tea, it has the most proven therapeutic properties.Green tea tends to have a more delicate and herbal aroma. It has very little theine or caffeine; depending on the variety, the quantity may be between 8 and 16 mg per cup. By comparison, a cup of espresso can easily have more than 200 mg of caffeine. Here are some of the most highly regarded varieties:‚Ä¢ Bancha. Alongside Sencha, although of lesser quality, it is the most common tea in Japan. Very low in theine.‚Ä¢ Genmaicha. Green tea with toasted rice; is frequently drunk with meals by the Japanese.‚Ä¢ Gunpowder. A Chinese tea with a strong flavor, which also appeals to fans of black tea. Often in the form of leaves compressed into a small ball.‚Ä¢ Kokeicha. Three-year tea; is very valued in Japan. It is made by toasting very fine twigs four times. Then the twigs are pulverized and pressed into fine needles.‚Ä¢ Kukicha. Made up of the stems of tea leaves, it makes a yellowish infusion with a distinctive flavor and very little theine.‚Ä¢ Lung Ching. This tea is the lung ching (‚Äúdragonwell‚Äù). It comes from the lake region of Hangzho, China. It is celebrated for its emerald color and sweet taste.‚Ä¢ Matcha. Powdered green tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony; yields a rich, astringent, jade-colored infusion.‚Ä¢ Sencha. A Japanese classic. Also available in a decaffeinated version.Mu Tea. The so-called mu tea does not contain tea leaves; it is actually a unique mixture of sixteen plants and spices, revived in the last few decades from an ancient oriental tradition. It has a very particular taste and is wonderful for digestion. **Black tea**&amp;#x200B;[Black Tea]([Black tea]( is obtained through an oxidation process. Freshly harvested leaves are left in humid rooms so they ferment. This treatment lasts between three and five hours depending on the variety, which gives the tea its characteristic dark green or black color.Black tea has a strong flavor‚Äîcloser to coffee‚Äîand can be combined with milk. It has a higher quantity of caffeine than green tea has. Each cup contains between 25 and 100 mg, depending on the degree of fermentation.Among the most popular varieties of black tea are:‚Ä¢ [Assam]( A full-bodied tea with a warm brown color. The Camellia assamica‚Äîa different plant than Sinensis‚Äîis grown in the northeast region of India.‚Ä¢ Ceilan. The ancient name for Sri Lanka is given to this delicate and aromatic black tea. It is commonly sold in bags.‚Ä¢ Darjeeling. Called ‚Äúthe champagne of teas‚Äù for its delicate fragrance and flavor. It is grown on the slopes of the Indian Himalayas. It is also sold decaffeinated.‚Ä¢ Earl Grey. Classic British mix of black tea with bergamot. It is one of the most commonly purchased bagged teas.**Leaves from the sky**The Darjeeling valley is found in the northeast region of India, on the border with Nepal. Eighty-seven tea plantations in this region have a 125-year history. The plant is grown at elevations between 1,970 and 7,050 feet (600 and 2,150 meters), on steep mountainsides that drain heavy monsoon rains.The tea that grows in this region is of unmatched quality, a bundle of it falling somewhere between sweet grapes and ripe peaches. Between April and May the First Flush is harvested, tender young teas that produce a very light infusion. The second harvest, or Second Flush, occurs in July and August, and produces a bright infusion with a more intense flavor. This is considered ideal for after-dinner drinks.&amp;#x200B;[leaves from Sky](‚Ä¢ English Breakfast. Invented by a merchant in the nineteenth century, this is a very strong black tea to help you wake up in the morning.‚Ä¢ Keemun. From Chinese, ‚Äúmountain of the lion.‚Äù This is a very high-quality tea grown in the humid mountains of Anhui. Its aroma is like that of an orchid.‚Ä¢ Kenya. Brightly colored and intensely aromatic, this is one of the black teas with the most body. It is grown at high altitudes in the African country and is usually sold as a powder.‚Ä¢ Lady Grey. This is a more fruity‚Äîand feminine‚Äîversion of Earl Grey. In addition to bergamot it contains rose petal and orange peel.‚Ä¢ Lapsang souchong. This robust Chinese tea has a characteristic smoky taste, from the process of drying leaves over a wood fire.‚Ä¢ Samovar. A very popular mixture developed in Russia from Chinese black tea with a touch of smokiness.‚Ä¢ Sumatra. This is a black tea with an intense, but slightly sweet, flavor. It is grown in the Indonesian island of the same name.**Blue tea**This is the name sometimes given to semi-fermented teas, also called Oolong. Instead of completing the oxidation, the fermentation is stopped mid-process‚Äîusually after about two hours. The result is a tea halfway between green and black. It has a balanced flavor with a combination of the characteristics of green and black teas, and is very popular in Taiwan. The caffeine content depends on when the fermentation is interrupted and can vary from 10 to 55 mg per cup.**Yellow tea**The leaves of this tea are left to mature rather than ferment. These are varieties that are difficult to find commercially. Yellow tea takes its name from the color of the infusion it produces. It has a singular and defined taste that can be slightly bitter. Its fresh scent leaves the mouth clean and dry. Its flavor‚Äîsomewhere between sweet and bitter‚Äîlingers on the tip of the tongue after drinking it.Chun Shan Yin Chin is considered the best and most valuable yellow tea. Mao-chien and Huang Da Cha are other popular varieties.**Red tea**There is some confusion about what is popularly known as ‚Äúred tea.‚Äù The Chinese give this name to Pu-er, a variety of green tea that only grows in the Yunnan region and is fermented to darken it. This ‚Äútea of the Emperor,‚Äù so-called because it originally was reserved only for the highest offices of power, is frequently used in diets today because of its ‚Äúfat-eliminating‚Äù qualities.Sometimes ‚Äúred tea‚Äù is used to refer to Rooibos, a South African plant with a sweet taste and invigorating and healing properties, which belongs to a botanical family unrelated to tea.**White tea**White tea is grown in many parts of China. It is lightly fermented and gives a very lightly colored infusion. In some plants, the leaf appears to have a white fuzz. The buds are harvested just two days of the year, in spring, and are picked by hand. It takes approximately 80,000 buds to produce only 250 grams of tea; this is why the price is so high.The legend of the white teaPopular tradition tells that in ancient China, this type of tea was harvested exclusively by maidens with gold scissors, and only the emperor had the right to taste it. The location of the sacred gardens was itself a mystery, and those few who discovered it paid with their lives. Pai Hao Yin Chin is a fairytale about this white tea.In Fujian, there was once a drought so severe that nothing could be harvested for many seasons. Then a plague ravaged the country and many people died. The situation got worse and worse and the elders recommended they go search for a sacred plant that grew beside the well of a dragon, in a nearby mountain. The juice of this plant, they said, would bring back the land‚Äôs prosperity and cure the sick.Many brave young people from Fujian went to the mountains in search of this sacred plant, but none of them returned, since the well was guarded by a fierce black dragon. Two brothers and their sister decided to go on the search. The oldest was the first to go, but he did not return. The second departed and suffered the same fate. Finally, the younger sister decided to go in search of her brothers and the plant. When she got there, she found that the dragon had turned the men to stone. Using her wits, she managed to steal the plant and kill the dragon with an arrow. With a few drops of the sacred plants, she brought the men back to life and they returned to the town and planted the seeds. The land became fertile once more and the sick were healed.From that day on, all of the plants in Fujian, a province at an altitude of 6000 meters, were of white tea, which is grown there to this day.&amp;#x200B;White tea has a much softer taste and scent than the other teas, and it contains the least amount of theine: about 1 mg per cup. It is highly valued for its therapeutic properties since its antioxidant power is triple that of green tea. The most well-known varieties are Shou mei, Pai hao Yin chin, and Pai mu tan.**Aromatic teas**Normally these are made from lower-quality leaves. In western shops, they are most often mixed based on black tea, although there are some classics made with green tea like that jasmine‚Äîhighly valued in China‚Äîor Japanese lime.Tea gourmets always prefer the pure varieties, but if they are to consume aromatic tea, they opt for flower accents.The fragrance of the flowers is incorporated into the leaves during processing.It is essential to achieve the right balance between tea and flowers so the fragrance does not cover the natural flavor of the tea.

1224,tea,"# The history of tea**A legendary origin**The first documents that mention [***tea***]( date back to the period between the seventh and sixth centuries BC. The inhabitants of ancient China in this period sang of the excellence of Tu, the name given to the group of plants which we now know as tea. This is the official origin, although if we give credit to popular legend, tea has been around since approximately the year 2700 BC. Between the years 206 BC and 221 AD, during the Han dynasty, improved methods of gathering and preparing tea leaves made tea a popular beverage of the royal family. Its prestige among the nobility grew, reaching its peak in the period of the Three Kingdoms (221‚Äì277 AD), when tea served as a substitute for wine at the court‚Äôs banquets.**Emperor Chen Nung**The French writer Maxence Fermine describes, in his novel Opium, the discovery of tea in China: ‚ÄúOne day, more than four thousand years ago, the emperor Chen Nung was traveling with his guard through a distant region of his great country. As the journey was long and tiring, he ordered them to let him stop to rest in the shade of some trees to protect them from the sun. The convoy stopped and the emperor sat cross-legged under an unknown bush. Immediately, he asked for a bowl of boiling water, as he was thirsty and it was the best remedy he knew to quench his thirst. His servants hurried to bring it to him. At that moment, a leaf fell into the emperor‚Äôs bowl. Chen Nung drank the water without notice, and when he did a sweet yet bitter aroma filled his throat. Intrigued, he looked into the bowl and found the leaf that gave this fascinating scent and flavor. And thus tea was born.‚Äù&amp;#x200B;[Tea in China]( The general population would wait another five centuries before experiencing the goodness of this virtuous plant, since it wasn‚Äôt until the Tang dynasty, from 618 to 907 AD, that tea became the national beverage of China. Proof of this is that a philosopher of the time, Lu Yu, wrote the first account of its history, cultivation, and preparation in 780 AD: the Cha-Ching.‚ÄùTea‚Äôs reputation reached every corner of China, thanks to caravans of merchants that crisscrossed the country. In 705 AD, Camellia sinensis crossed borders for the first time and was introduced in Japan by a monk named Dengyo Daishi. During this same time period, tea arrived in Tibet and was a great success. There they boiled tablets of pressed tea and then mixed it with butter and salt. It wasn‚Äôt until the start of the twentieth century that tea in the form of infusion became popular there, although there are still many Tibetans that prefer the traditional preparation.**Tibetan style tea**In his memoir, Seven Years in Tibet, mountain climber Heinrich Harrer (played in the movie by Brad Pitt) describes the local custom of drinking tea mixed with yak lard, a combination that he found horrifying. The author commented that some Tibetans claimed to drink more than a hundred cups a day.**Beyond China**Tea had begun to cross borders at the beginning of the ninth century when the first shipments arrived by boat to Korea and Japan. There, a Buddhist monk called Yesai published the first Japanese book on tea in 1191. Both countries began to cultivate tea in the humid, mountainous regions, and their inhabitants soon learned of the therapeutic properties of the infusion. Zen monks incorporated tea in their routines in the temple, in combination with meditation that lasted all day.[Tea Collection -Black Green Burgundy white Tea](Regarding the union between Buddhism and tea, the legend tells that an Indian prince named Drama had decided to devote his life to prayer. Abandoning his home, he began a pilgrimage toward China and Japan. Exhausted from the hard days of journeying, he succumbed to a deep sleep along the banks of a river and slept for a long time. Upon waking, he felt horrified by his laziness and meted himself a severe punishment so as not to succumb to sleep again: he cut off his eyelids and buried them in the place where he had slept. Many years later, returning to his home, he passed that same place and discovered that a strange bush was growing where he had buried the eyelids. The monk chewed a few leaves and realized that they helped keep the mind awake. Since then, the Zen monks have always cultivated tea in the monastery gardens.**From ‚Äúcha‚Äù to ‚Äútea‚Äù**The names given for the word ‚Äútea‚Äù are very similar throughout Asia: in Japan, it‚Äôs called cha, in Russia caj, in India tschaj and in China, ch‚Äôa. Some linguists maintain that it‚Äôs possible all these names come from the word for ‚Äúvitality‚Äù in Chinese, chi.In the Fukien province of China, the Dutch learned the word tay, which means ‚Äútea‚Äù in the local dialect, and this sound was introduced to Europe. In fact, in Ireland and England, it was pronounced tay until the start of the eighteenth century, after which the word was derived to tee and then tea‚Äîas we know it today.In many European languages, the same word is used as a generic term for herbal teas or an infusion of herbs.Apart from making the most of tea‚Äôs curative properties, the Japanese nobles also began to include tea in their social meetings. Thus was born the Cha no yu, the tea ceremony, a delicate and demanding ritual lasting several hours, for which the hosts would have expensive and precious utensils.&amp;#x200B;[English Tea Preparation](**Tea arrives in the West**The first record of the existence of tea in the West dates to the year 851 AD. It was written by an Arab merchant named Suleiman in his book Relations in China and India, where he defined it as ‚Äúan aromatic herb with a bitter taste that is drunk with boiled water in the East.‚ÄùApparently, westerners did not hear about this infusion again until 1529, when the Venetian Giambattista Ramusio wrote in his book Navigazione e Viaggi about the existence of a plant in the East that ‚Äúcalms pain of gout and also guarantees good stomach function.‚Äù Jesuit missionaries that visited China and Japan in the sixteenth century also spoke of a plant with a sweet taste that the natives called chai.[An Indian Old Man Enjoys Tea](**The East India Company**In the seventeenth century, the European powers competed to claim the new markets in Asia. During this process, the Dutch East India Company brought the first shipment of tea to Europe in 1606. Later, the ships of the English East India Company achieved a monopoly on tea and began to distribute it in France, Germany, and Portugal as well as England. In 1657, the first teahouse opened in London, and financial transactions involving the plant took place on its upper floors. But tea became popular in England a few years later, when King Charles II married Catalina de Berganza, a great fan of the beverage.The Portuguese princess brought with her dowry the port of Bombay, one of the most important hubs of maritime commerce between Asia and Europe, which became key in the tea trade between the two continents. The infusion began to be served in the court and, during the following century, became the most popular beverage in England, winning over even beer and gin.In 1834, the East India Company lost its monopoly on tea after the implementation of a British governmental resolution. With free competition between companies, the speed of the ships became more important, so large ships gave way to small, lightships called clippers. This produced true competition to be the first to arrive in port and be able to sell at the best price, resulting in all kinds of incidents and adventures on the high seas, as the typical passage took about a hundred days.The custom of adding milk to tea‚Äîso deeply entrenched in England today‚Äîwas introduced by the Dutch in the early seventeenth century and then spread to France and England. The Japanese and Chinese never add milk to tea because they believe it ruins the flavor, original color, and aroma of the infusion.Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, tea was drunk at any time of day. The creation of the British afternoon tea‚Äîat five o‚Äôclock‚Äîis attributed to the Duchess of Bedford, who after drinking it in the afternoon with a snack found it so delicious she instituted the ritual with all her friends.[Mango Tea](**The spread of tea**In 1810 the Chinese began to cultivate tea on the island of Formosa, in modern-day Taiwan. A decade later in Assam, in the northeastern region of India, Robert Bruce and his brother discovered vast thickets of tea growing naturally and established the tea industry in the then-British colony, including the Darjeeling region.In other parts of the world, tea arrived under more difficult circumstances. In Ceylan, modern-day Sri Lanka, the cultivation of tea began in earnest after a plague affecting coffee trees devastated all the plantations on the island‚Äîat that time it was the second-largest producer of coffee in the world.[Collection of Tea Around the world](In each country, tea has been introduced differently, with many local variations. The Maghrebis, for example, inherited tea from the English and their national drink is mint tea. It is served in a glass with a lot of sugar and accompanied by honey cakes. Proper etiquette dictates that the host should drink at least three glasses of tea, with the last one being stronger than the previous.In 1900, with the inauguration of the Trans-Siberian railroad, tea was no longer transported by camel from Peking to Russia. And four years later, Richard Blechyden presented a refreshing invention at the St. Louis World‚Äôs Fair: iced tea.",The history of tea

I have REALLY good teeth, but if I keep drinking soda, I could gain major cavities.

However, that was days ago, now I‚Äôm drinking water and haven‚Äôt touched soda in, like, 2 days. Now, I probably won‚Äôt quit soda forever, but I want to definitely lower my intake and daily consumption, cutting it down to maybe one soda a week. And I feel tea could probably fill that role. Just like most users who are asking about tea for the first time, I‚Äôm SUPER inexperienced. I‚Äôve never brewed or brought tea that wasn‚Äôt either Snapple or Gold Peak. I don‚Äôt even drink tea period, wasn‚Äôt my forte. However, i think I want to make the switch if it‚Äôll be better than soda, since I know I can‚Äôt keep drinking water forever, I‚Äôll eventually go cold Turkey sooner or later, and the cravings are sort of coming back. The question is‚Ä¶ where do I start? I‚Äôm a student in HS, so having a cup every day would be nice. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll buy tea online unless I get really invested. There is a Trader Joe‚Äôs near me and I read somewhere on the subreddit that TJ has good tea selections. Is brewing it hard, how do you get over the bitterness and not get tempted to put sugar, cream or milk in it? Should I go for honest teas in the meantime until I find good ‚Äúbrewed‚Äù teas?

There are some wonderful travel gongfu sets out there these days, but I'm wondering if there's anything out there that can really keep a container of near-boiling water for a few hours.Lets say I boil water at home, put it in a pre-warmed vessel, travel 0.5-1.5 hours, hike for an hour, and then want to make a pu'er to share with my friend(s) (so at least 500-700ml). In a typical thermos I'm skeptical that the water will remain close enough to boiling to be useful, though peraps for a green or oolong, maybe black if the trip is on the shorter side. A video demonstration from Zojirushi shows about 40 degrees drop from boiling in 6 hours, so if we can assume linear drop, that means -20 degrees after 3hr, bringing it to about green/oolong territoryThere exist car-lighter powered boilers, but I often won't be traveling in a car. [Another redditor explained why it's unlikely a USB powered kettle would exist]( but this also assumes you're boiling water from scratch, I think it wouldn't be so bad if you were using fairly hot water like in the above scenario and using a heating element to slow the temperature drop...Which brought me to the existence of temperature controlled travel mugs, but from what I can see these are also almost all car-powered, though a few battery powered ones are out there but they mostly top out around 140F.Lastly there's the camping approach, but almost any fuel stove and pot to boil water will be bigger than the entire travel gongfu set, so unless I was actually camping I think this would be untenable for an enjoyable hike.Anyone have any other ideas? Have I unfairly discounted one of the above approaches? Or does anyone have experience trying this? Maybe the tried and true thermos is ""good enough""... I know I can always lower my expectations, but if it's possible, I'd love to make it happen.",Gongfu on the go (ie hiking) - whats the best solution for boiling hot water?

I don't have the best experience with it let's say, let me explain.So I wanted to start drinking tea/black coffee like a year ago, and introduced the both of them gradually to my diet. I didn't like black coffee at first but over time, I learned to love it (it tastes great to me now). For tea however, I haven't introduced it to the same extent, probably because my parents don't drink them = don't buy em.I drank ginger tea as a child and that was somewhat traumatic as a kid. Started chamomile tea a year ago (thinking I'd like it) but it only tasted like.... flowers? I onlt had like 5 cups. I've pretty much only had like 8 cups of hot tea throughout my life, which probably impacted its taste for me.I want to drink more of it and get its acquired taste, just like I had with coffee. Don't know where to start though. I'm thinking green tea is a safe start but then again my knowledge about this all is limited. Any help is appreciated, thank you!",Where to start?

Teas tried before:Black: Smoked Lapsang Souchong (absolutely loved it), Keemun (not really a fan, have tried medium and high quality, it's doable with milk).Oolongs (likely my favourite type): Da Hong Pao (loved &amp; have a ton), Rou Gui (loved), Dongfang Meiren, Tie Guan Yin, and Pheonix Oolong (all three liked quite a bit). White: Silver Needle (decent, oddly preferred lower quality than high due to astringency). Green: Dragon Well (decent, good at room temp with rock sugar), Organic Green (meh). Pu'er: Golden Pu'er (really liked, even with the fishy smell).Not sure if that helps for a flavour profiling, but I seem set for Oolongs, and I guess I don't really like Green or White (though will keep some on hand for the lightness), and I will likely need to pick up a decent Pu'er when I get an YiXing tea pot.

1642,tea,"I know this isn‚Äôt generally a practice a lot of wine drinkers include in their tasting, but I have been doing it a lot lately to my enjoyment and was wondering if it‚Äôs something anyone else does or if there is anything to it. I‚Äôm relatively new to wine but I‚Äôve been drinking it in - literally and intellectually - a lot in the past few months, and I‚Äôve noticed that the aroma of different wines left at the bottom of the empty glass are not unpleasant, and are very different from each other and the wines that used fill the glasses. I can pick out distinct notes, and to my nose, they can broaden the wine‚Äôs flavor profile. They can even sometimes show if a winemaker was cutting corners by adding artificial flavors to a cheaper wine.Why I even considered taking this practice semi-seriously: I also like drinking tea in the traditional Chinese style known as gongfu. A big part of enjoying your tea this way is smelling your empty cup (or gaiwan) after you have finished it. All of the antioxidants, oils, and flavor compounds are the most concentrated and fragrant when your cup is empty, and it produces a warmer, richer nose than any other way to smell tea, be it the wet leaves or the the drink itself. The name for this is bƒìi xiƒÅng, and it is a fundamental part of tea tasting.I haven‚Äôt found that wine drinkers often include this in the process of their own tasting and aside from cultural differences and practices from the east to the west, I suspect it‚Äôs because wine and tea are very different kinds of beverages, and wine oxidizes very quickly when there is a high surface area to volume ratio. That being said, the multitudes of flavor compounds are still there, only a minority of them oxidize straightaway, and the alcohol does the same evaporative legwork that a heated gaiwan does in concentrating the aroma. More importantly, in this novice‚Äôs opinion (who hardly has a grasp on any of the science behind this) the empty glass smells quite good, better than the actual wine smells in a few cases.Let me know what you, think, and if I‚Äôm completely talking out of my ***, let me know why I‚Äôm wrong so we can all learn together :)",Smelling Empty Wine Glasses

I have been watching some resources on YouTube, Mei Leaf for the most part, and I have some ideas i would like to discuss with some people that know much more about tea than i do.   So, after i had gotten my quality tea, i still wasnt happy about how the tea tasted. It was full of bitterness and left my tongue very dry, I'm assuming those are the tannins working their magic. I therefore troubleshooted my process and turned out im brewing with too much leaf for too long, and in one of those tea balls. I then watched Mei Leafs video where he showed off the \[Conniseur Tea Brewer\]([ and i thought ""My, oh my, that works a lot like some coffee brewers that are very popular, the \[Hario Switch\]([ (timelapse where you can see easily how it works), or the Clever Dripper. They are basically holders for a coffee filter with a valve at the bottom. You rinse your filter, put in your coffee and water and let it infuse french press style, and then you open the valve after the desired brew time to release the coffee through the paper filter and into the cup. I then thought to myself ""How is this different to what that tea brewer is doing?"", and that is where you guys come in.   Would the Hario Switch be a viable tea brewer?   Is filtering tea through a (pre rinsed) coffee filter a bad thing?   Do you see any other problems using these brewers?   Do you see any overlap between tea and coffee?

1780,tea,"Very sad :(So for the last two years I was an absolute tea fiend. Like, to obsessive, unhealthy levels lmao. White/green/oolong/pu-er/matcha/black you name it, loved it. Drank 5 cups a day, every time I went to the supermarket would walk through the tea aisle literally just to inhale the scent; would even frequently eat the leaves, wet or dry.Anyway, all that to say tea was a huge part of my life, and I couldn't really imagine going without it. Then January this year, contacted covid. Was very mild fortunately. During that time was only drinking water/hydralyte. Never lost my sense of smell or taste at any point (which is what I was initially worried about)-- but ever since, the one lingering effect is that I have completely lost my appetite for tea. Would even go so far as to say the thought of tea almost repels me. This goes for every type of tea. And it's not like they smell any different than before, it's just I feel my brain flicked a switch and decided not to enjoy it any more. I think I've only drunk 2 cups since January and I didn't enjoy them much at all. They were some of my favorites too (milk oolong, sencha). It's just so strange to me, and honestly it makes me so sad. I hope one day I can once again enjoy tea like I used to.

Left to my own devices I would drink it daily, but I have Crohn's disease and there are occasions I have to give up all caffeine for a few months at a time when I am having a flare/digestive issues.

1818,tea,"I've spent the last few weeks perfecting my iced tea method, and I wanted to share it because it is a departure from the typical iced tea approach. I find that the standard method of brewing iced tea in one huge batch and steeping it for 5 minutes or more does a disservice to the flavor of the tea, usually in the form of an overly tannic/bitter finish.  Sometimes traditionally-brewed iced tea is drinkable, but for me, iced tea made the typical way is never *great*. The method I'm sharing here makes a far better iced tea, and borrows its main principles from gong fu style brewing ( it uses more leaf, less water, shorter steeps). It requires more hands-on time, and it does use ***a lot more tea*** than the standard iced tea method,  but the overall amount of time it takes me to make iced tea this way is actually a bit less than the ""standard"" way and the flavor is going to be incredible. If you're someone who likes to make iced tea out of high-quality leaves, I think you'll appreciate that you're getting a more true-to-flavor beverage this way. This approach produces full-flavored iced tea with excellent dimension, color, and body with no bitterness. It works equally well for black, oolong, green, and white teas, and it also produces great results with flavored and scented teas.   **Supplies:***To brew tea this way, you'll need:*  1. Loose leaf tea ‚Äî whatever kind of tea you like will work, just not teabags. 2. A glass pitcher for iced tea. I use an 800mL (\~28 oz.) glass pitcher. I recommend shooting for 750mL-800mL for this method, particularly if you are using flavored or scented teas. You want to be able to fill this container with 2-3 steeps; after that, flavored tea can get a weird and bland IME. If you're brewing with pure teas, you could go bigger if  you wanted since those tend to hold up through more steeps. 3. A 350mL-500mL teapot with strainer. You can go bigger if you want, but I very strongly recommend steeping no more than 400mL of tea at once and doing multiple steeps. Doing it this way will get you more dimension in the flavor of your finished product. I also recommend a strainer that is large enough to allow enough room for your tea leaves to open up fully.  4. A kitchen scale 5. An electric kettle with variable temperature settings (optional, but it does make this a lot easier)*I have recs for the tea pitcher and the teapot w/ strainer if you need them, but I don't want to post those here so people don't mistake me for a teaware shill. And if you already own stuff that's pretty close to what I'm describing, it will work great! But if you want to know what I'm using, send me a message and I'll happily tell you.*  **Instructions:**1. Using the tea amounts specified below, add the leaf to your pot.2. Heat your water to the temps specified below. Add the heated water to your pot 350mL to 400mL at a time.3. Steep according to the time chart below based on your tea. You will need to do 2-3 steeps to fill an 800mL4. **I do not add ice to the pitcher!** I only add ice to my glass when I'm ready to pour a glass of tea. And I always chill the tea in the fridge first. I like to make the tea the night before I plan on drinking it and chilling the tea in the fridge overnight. **TEA AMOUNT (per 100mL of water)*** *I'm usually brewing around 350mL of tea at a time, so for example, if I were making green tea, I use 14g of tea leaf, which is 3.5 x 4g. If I were brewing 400mL at a time, then I would use 16g of tea.** *These numbers are approximate, it's okay to go a little more or less, depending on your tastes.*   *White:*   4g\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Green:*   4g\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Oolong:*   6g\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Black:*   4g\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_&amp;#x200B;**WATER TEMPS**  *White:*   90C / 175F\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Green:*   80C / 175F\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Oolong:*   95C / 205F\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Black:*   90C / 195F\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_&amp;#x200B;**STEEP TIMES (in SECONDS, not minutes!)*** *I don't rinse my leaves before making iced tea, so I'm not including any rinse times here** *If you're using pearl style tea you might need to add a little time to the first steep to give the balls time to unfurl, but I admittedly haven't iced any pearl teas yet so I don't have any specific recommendations on timing for those** *These are the times that work best for me, but you can adjust according to your preference.
