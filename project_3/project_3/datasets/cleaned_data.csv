The grind size as always may be the most important factor to consider. So I started to calibrate my Comandante MK4 using the Kruve sifter.Kruve recommends that grind sizes to be from 400μm to 1200μm. So I started grinding 8 grams of beans with 30 clicks away (CCW) from the zero setting of the Comandante.The result wasn't very satisfying and lots of coarser grounds remained in the upper chamber of the Kruve sifter. Below you can find my best results. Also note that my coffee beans are a medium roast blend from a local roastery.Comandante setting: 22 clicks8 gr of beans0.75 gr waste (mostly coarser than 1200μm grounds)Comandante setting: 20 clicks8 gr of beans0.57 gr waste (mostly finer than 400μm grounds)Comandante setting: 19 8 gr of beans0.48 gr watse (almost only finer than 400μm grounds)So you can adjust your Comandante grinder somewhere between 19 to 22 depending on your bean roast profile.Hope it helps Coffee grind size for SCA cupping using Comandante and Kruve sifter

Initially, I purchased the Krups Precision Grinder since it seemed like a good entry for my daily drip coffee needs. After using it for a day or two, I couldn't help but think the amount of coffee being dispensed was way too much when using the suggested cup selection. It became too difficult to manage so I replaced it with a Bevi grinder, which has a bit more functionality and an option for time based grinds as well. Yet, again, I'm finding it to be producing so much coffee when using the suggested cup selection. IHave I been drinking weak coffee this entire time? Should I try for a more coarser or finer grinder to reduce the amount being dispensed or will that even help? Just seems like so much coffee! I just need enough coffee perfectly grinded daily for my 48 oz of water. Someone tell me what I'm doing incorrectly please. :) Burr Grinders Seem to Produce a lot of Coffee!"

I recently bought a used espresso machine (a local Korean brand named Boral), which is classified here as a ""semi-automatic"" coffee machine. It has a small pressure gauge. For my grinder, I'm using a Baratza Maestro (Plus?), which I had calibrated to the finer setting, and the finest I can get my grind ⠀to can be seen from this image:  The problem I have is with how the machine is extracting way too quickly (12\~15 seconds for a 1:2 ratio). Fresh beans and old beans same story. And so I imagined, from several google search results, that my grind is probably too coarse. And so, going against some people's advice, I tried using a food processor (blender) to get it finer and finer. The coffee became extra fine and the coffee machine started to choke (the pressure gauge with the Baratza grind only goes up to 5\~7 bars of pressure while going over 10 with the finer grind), with a minimum of 25 seconds of brew time and some going over 1 minute for a 1:2 ratio. But I've watched a few videos online and it seemed as if the grind they were using weren't much finer than what my Baratza grinder was putting out. And so finally the question I have is, is my grinder simply not enough? Or is it my espresso machine? (As in, would other espresso machines have good brew times with the type of grind I'm getting from my grinder). Thank you. I don't know whether my espresso machine is at fault or if I just need a better grinder."

I thought maybe I got a few dud filters that were too small so I tried it three more times and it kept happening.I read that you could use a regular coffee filter by laying a square over the perforated cap, tightening the cap and then trimming the extra paper so I tried that. same thing happened again. I really can't think what could be wrong apart from maybe there is an imperceptible hairline crack? because the parts and procedure seem idiot proof. I should note I am using very finely powdered coffee and the first three times it was very hard to plunge no matter how slowly I did it  (but I didn't hear a crack). not sure what to do at this point aside from trying more filters and maybe replacing the brown perforated cap.suggestions would be great! thanks aeropress: coffee is flowing out the edges of paper filter."

I was able to run four 40g doses through it without any issues but on the fifth time using it, it would no longer dispense coffee.After cleaning according to the instructions, I found that the bottom blade was catching either on the walls of the grinder or on the axle.  The tolerances are as such that I can't really tell where the snag is. I am also unable to remove the blade at all -- I can get it to rise about a centimeter or so up the axle but then the blade will bind again. I lowered the blade and it appears to spin freely when seated on the bottom of the grinder, but when I grind, it will only dispense about 8 grams and then no longer dispenses.  The conical burr will rotate but it's the bottom blade that is snagging. I'm not grinding any beans that are dark roasted or oily -- they are medium roasted hard African beans.  I performed this operation about three times with the same results and sent an email to Niche about it.  I'm wondering if anyone with the same build date has had similar issues -- perhaps an issue with the milling of the blade or the axle perhaps? Issues with a new Niche Zero (Jan 2022 build date)"

Specifically, I'm looking to switch from a hand grinder to an electric grinder. I'll try to give you guys as much information on my current grinding and brewing:I currently own an 1Zpresso JX Pro hand grinder. I'm quite happy with it as it produces vastly better distributions than the cheap Hario grinder I used before and because it's easy to use. I opted for a hand grinder because it's better value for money in terms of grinding performance and I didn't know yet how far I was going to go with my ""coffee game"". I only make filter coffee at the moment.There are two reasons why I wish to buy a new grinder that is electric:1) As I use my grinder that much and I expect to be grinding more often for more than one cup at a time, the convenience of an electric grinder is something I'd value greatly.2) While I know that my current grinder is pretty good, there's room to grow. So as my experience and ""brewing skills"" grow, I thought I'd make an investment into my hobby by buying a good electric grinder that could last me for a bit.A couple of things that may be relevant for which grinder to choose:- I live in Europe (Switzerland), so I can only buy what can be shipped to Germany or Switzerland and I can only use a machine with the correct voltage.- As mentioned, I currently only make filter coffee, not espresso but I could imagine switching to espresso at some point (once I can afford it).- Needless to say, I'd wish for an improvement in performance compared to my current grinder, so entry level electric grinders in a similar price range as my grinder would be out of the question.- If I choose a filter focused grinder, I'd want it to be able to reliably grind fine enough. I remember Hoffmann's review of the Fellow Ode, saying that he worries that it doesn't grind fine enough for a one cup V60. My Aeropress and Moka pot are even finer than my one cup V60, so maybe a grinder that is made to be able to do espresso but able to do filter well as well would be good (?), something like the Niche.Feel free to ask me for more clarifications.Thanks a lot Looking for a new grinder, could use some advice"

I solved this by releasing one drop of water in the beans before grinding them, in order to kill off all the static electricity and not waste any coffee or do extra cleaning after each use, but yesterday evening I watched [this video]( from European Coffee Trip (video should start at 12:27), where they say that it is actually a good idea to let the static electricity build up and avoid knocking out the fines from the grinder, so that they have less chance of adding bitterness to the cup.&amp;#x200B;I never thought about it this way, but the way he describes it does make sense. What are your thoughts about this? I tried it first time today and didn't notice any difference, but I'm curious to keep trying this method.

I'm sure someone with enough experience in tasting coffee will be able to tell the difference between the same coffee, with one of the two being more evenly extracted (better grinder, immersion, better technique, etc.). But tasting is not measuring and as with extraction, it's probably most useful to combine what you think based on what you taste with a refractometer measurement to really learn what's going on. Is there a good (reliable) way to measure evenness of extraction?"

I brewed two cups today, and thought I'd share my results! First cup was a medium-light Ethiopian natural I roasted at home. In the V60, I was getting pretty balanced cups but maybe a touch under extracted. In the Blue Bottle Dripper, (BBD, henceforth) as soon as I lifted the dripper off the cup I was smacked in the face by the aroma of hot sugar. (Think cotton candy.) Flavor-wise, it was what you expect from an Ethiopian natural. Jammy, aggressively floral. My favorite thing about it was the body, though. I've never had a cup of filter coffee that was so syrupy! It was pretty high strength, and veeery high extraction at ~24%. Second cup was a darker roasted blend I bought from a new coffee shop in the area. It's the one they brew in house for filter coffee, and I think it's a great example of a specialty dark roast! (Dark-ish, really.) I didn't measure extraction, but I was still impressed. There was a candy banana note I never tasted in my V60 or Aeropress cups, and again, much heavier body. This could be down to different filter paper, but either way, I like it! My personal experience with the V60 is that you usually have to trade high extraction for clarity. You can get a sweeter cup, but usually with less flavor separation than a bright cup. So far, it seems like you don't make that trade with the BBD. A few caveats: with only two brews down, I may find things to dislike about the dripper with time. Coming from a plastic V60, I'm nervous about dropping or breaking. Some coffees may benefit from a bit lower EY, and I don't know if that will be easy to do on the BBD. Also, it doesn't fit neatly on the glass body of my French Press, which I usually use as a server. For all that, though, I'm super stoked to explore what it can do! I think I pretty comprehensively covered my experience, but drop your questions/advice/experience too! First Experience with Blue Bottle Dripper"

I pre-ordered the Niche in March and it was delivered last week.  I am aware that popular opinion is that the Wilfa is better for V60 and the Niche for espressos but I have to admit I didn’t expect such a marked difference in V60 quality. My main objection with the Wilfa was the noise and that it scatters grinds everywhere when you pull the basket out.  In these respects the Niche has it beaten but that’s about it as far as I can tell. I’m grinding light roast beans at setting 45 on the Niche and although the grinds look about right and certainly appear ‘fluffier’ I am surprised by the amount of fines the Niche is producing.  I would hardly get any with the Wilfa but now the paper on the V60 is black with fine sludge.  I am not convinced the coffee is any more delicious with the Niche. Maybe I am doing it wrong? I’m going to buy a Flair 58 and get into espresso and perhaps at that point I’ll ‘get’ the Niche.  If it carries on like this the Wilfa will be coming back out.

Using my Gaggia Classic Pro (with 9bar opv mod) and a Sette 30, but I still haven't got one single good espresso shot. I tried dark roast, different grind sizes from 10 on the Sette, to 8 with different dosings (15,5g - 17g) in the double basket which came with the GCP. All within 20-30s tasted way too bitter, so I tried a medium roast. Same story, all way too bitter. Now I tried a lighter roast, again different grind settings from 9 to 5 and dosings from 15,5g - 17,5g, but these were all waaaay too sour/acidic. Tried shots from 22ish seconds - 38s. Haven't tasted anything 'sweet' in all the shots I pulled.I think I will earn a reward for watching all the youtube tutorials on how to dial in, but still no reward for good espresso... Maybe I overlook something, or just don't have the skills to pull a good espresso shot. Hopefully somebody can give me good tips on how to set the base right. Espresso beginner, still no good shots"

This equates for us metric folks as approximately 30ml/30g per shot, 60g for a double espresso. The grounds on the input side being around 9g for a single shot, 18g for a double.My confusion is that many, many other sources, particularly on YT, indicate that the 'God Shot' of espresso, is 18g in and based upon a 1:2 ratio, 36-40g out, in 25-30 seconds. Now even my basic maths, can see that 36g is significantly different, as a measure of double espresso to the 2oz/60g standard measure, quoted by innumerable sources.Both can't be right, so is one over-extracting or is the other under-extracting?

My preference is to also stay away from anything that relies on any sort of app or Wifi connectivity.I’ve used a moka pot in the past and wasn’t a real fan. I also don’t need something with all sorts of bells or whistles like an integrated grinder, frother and scale as I already have a Baratza Virtuoso and accessible kitchen scale. Really just something that’s capable of pulling two shots and has a removable water tank to measure out the water I suppose.I was gifted a Ninja coffee maker for Christmas that had all sorts of functions, but it unfortunately had one of those capacitive buttons with a menu you had to cycle through to pick what you wanted to do. There was no way I could use it.I know you can go down the rabbit hole when it comes to espresso, but I’d like to keep my budget around $600 max.If anyone’s got any suggestions or hands-on input on any models that can be operated mainly with tactile buttons and or switches/levers, I’d appreciate it. Thanks, Espresso machines accessible to the blind"

I just want a nice extraction, as I can't smell the coffee in my urine when I brew it myself, so I'm forced to go to Starbucks (is this the conspiracy? LOL). I've read reviews of a machine that sells for $1200 and they say that the water isn't hot that that they recommend you brew the water yourself on a kettle. Why do businesses do this? Any suggestions? Are there any espresso machines that brew at 200 degrees F?"

I know this requires a few things like a coffee maker, grounds, flavorings, etc. I just don’t know where to start, considering there are even multiple methods one can use to make iced coffee.I’ll say this, generally I think an easier set-up for her would be best. I don’t think any extra effort when preparing the coffee would be worth the extra quality for her, if there are multiple ways to go about it.Generally looking to spend like a grand total of 150 on everything.Any ideas on the best supplies to buy?

I've always taken milk and sugar in my coffee to cover the less pleasant tastes of my old coffee but what I'm getting out of my aeropress is great as is and I'm enjoying black coffee for the first time in my life. I got so sick of the bad coffee off the food truck at work that I bought an Aeropress and I love it.

A couple years ago my wife got into the elector tea kettle game and it was a game changer. I’ve been getting re-acquainted with the process for a couple weeks now and I have to agree that it’s the best cup of coffee I’ve ever made at home. I didn’t have a coffee grinder, electric kettle or a food scale when I had my first press. These are essential to making the French press process as simple as possible. I’m a big fan of a process/routine. The weighing, grinding, blooming, stirring, steeping, pressing etc… process is a nice slow but intentional way for me to start my morning.

With a frequency of 3-5seconds between each pulse (engagement).I presume that there may be either a problem with the pump itself, an associated solenoid (or the [Auto-level Sensor - Part # 09000003]) however, rather than just changing parts here and there (a layman repair technique), I was wondering if anyone has had a similar problem, and could provide either insight (about the problem, symptoms and solution) or to clarify a way to accurately diagnose if this is the case?For example - is there a voltage / resistance that can be measured with a multimeter to check that the sensor is indeed working, and if the voltage / resistance is fluctuating correctly with the operation of the machine?The rapid engaging / disengaging (off and on -&gt; ‘clicking’) isn’t actually adding water to the boiler at all, and I suspect that it is impeding the warm-up time of the machine, and potentially wearing out the pump with it’s intermittent operation.I haven’t timed the machine’s warm up, that can be done - if required, but any information that could be of assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Not in a way that they turned bad or undrinkable but just a stale and bad smellHowever I sometimes also buy preground coffee  (or find it on vacation when renting a place) and eventhough I have those bags for a long time and they are old they still smell and taste pretty much as they did on day 1. Still very enjoyable without that horrible stale smell and tasteWhy is that? Is ground coffee more durable than coffee beans?

If you go from a small serving at a given ratio, and then brew a larger batch at the same ratio in the same type of brewer, the grind has to be courser to stay ""dialed in."" But … by how much? Does anybody know?For example, I have noticed that when I dial in the perfect grind for a v60, it's no longer the correct grind if I brew at a different volume. Sometimes I do a little mug of 220g into 13g while other times, I might fill a big carter move with 450g into 29g. The perfect grind for each is wildly different.

Except I don't really find myself grinding beans, I just getting a decent bag of pre-ground from a local store that I like, measure x g of coffee and pour in x g of water and do my brew.Now I'm just looking for something more convenient. Set it and come back 5 min later to a cup. I don't want to use K-Cups or even the reusable pods, they are annoying to clean. And I do prefer paper filters, so I was hoping to get something that can use readily available #4 or #2 filters - my only source for Hario filters is online which is annoying.I thought about grabbing one of these: But just worried I may end up buying it and then measuring coffee/water and cleanup will be just as much of a hassle as pourover.Has anyone used both kinds before? What are your thoughts? Is a single serve (non pod) brewer any more convenient than pourover?"

There was a fiery debate about the definition of iced coffee so I'll TLDR that for you here as to my definition: Coffee that is traditional hot brewed, then cooled (preferably quickly) and then once cooled, poured over ice and drank.After many months of experimenting with both at home I have come to a realization about cold brew: It comes out SO MUCH better (IMO) when you use a light roast. I've been doing a 96 hour steep in the fridge, and have been coming to realize that when you use a darker roast it starts to taste further from what I associate with a ""coffee"" flavor, whereas when you use a medium or light roast there are a lot more flavors that come through. I'm not a fan of those Trader Joe's cold brew concentrates - and I find that that's what the darker roast CBs come to taste like.Not a forever convert, I like to switch off between both CB and IC (TBH I'm a sucker for a standard black Starbucks Iced Coffee - they really have it down), but certainly less of a CB hater now.TLDR: Cold brew is better when you use a medium or light roast.

I suspect the issue might be the grinder we have and the bulletproof brand coffee my mom likes, but it tastes like burnt dust to me. At my favorite cafés I like their coffee black, and at home I’ve tried adding milk direct out the fridge but that’s done little to ameliorate the situation. That is until I discovered I could warm the milk in a saucepan and whisk it until it goes to froth. Somehow this tastes 10x better than ordinary milky hot bean filth. Am I imagining this difference? Frothed milk makes crappy coffee taste great! Is this a placebo?"

I really like steel because glass cracks easily in the dishwasher.I also have a Krups burr grinder. So I expected some nice coffee - but am failing to make it. Instead, it's either watery or bitter.The Internet (tm) says use coarser grinds, somewhat large amounts of coffee, limit brewing to 5 minutes. But it gets bitter. Smaller amounts with a coarse grind get watery; with a finer grind, bitter again.I did also start preheating the steel french press first by keeping some freshly-boiled water in it, covered, for a minute while rocking the press. Things got somewhat better but not a lot.So what's the secret here? How can I work out the formula for coffee that would be full-bodied but not bitter?I did google now and there is that James Hoffman video with the idea of stirring after a  few minutes and then just throwing away what remains on top. Not sure this makes sense to me as the stirring already distributes all the bitter stuff? Maybe I should stir at the start of the brewing, then just take the top off after the (4 minute?) brewing before the plunging? Or what else do I do, anyway? Steel french press, burr grinder - how to make nice and not bitter coffee?"

Fellow just released their drops text-to-order subscription service which seems to be an interesting take on the whole subscription idea. But beyond them, most of the services feel the same. While I usually just go out and buy locally roasted coffee, I can see where subscription services could be useful. Specifically in places where there aren't any good roasters or limited variety. For people who use subscription services, what's the main driver for doing so? Is it mainly a convenience factor? Wanting to try new roasters from across the country? Or simply the easiest way to get well roasted coffee in your neck of the woods. Hopefully this post doesn't get taken down, I'd love to start a conversation around this topic.

Found my sweet spot and dose about 16.4g into the stock basket.To be fair, I got Covid, so all coffee was undrinkable for about 1.5 weeks because of the wonky taste &amp; smell issue, so I just left her alone. But today I had two good espressos. Yahoo! Finally! A decent espresso with my Rancilio Silvia!"

When I was younger, I convinced myself that coffee had to taste STRONG or I somehow wasn't a valid coffee drinker. I'm extremely sensitive to bitter tastes (supertaster), but I like aspects of black coffee, and I realized that I don't think I ever actually enjoyed any of the strong coffee I drank. I guiltily enjoyed 'weak' diner coffee, fast food coffee or the cheap coffee you'd get in those little teabag filters in hotel rooms. I tried my hand at pour-over, thinking that it would help me control the strength more, but that was too much work for multiple cups of coffee. On a whim, I bought a container of basic nabob instant coffee and it is THE BEST.

I've also had a Hario Switch that I've gotten decent results out of, though I've never really liked its lack of heat retention. Recently, I've just decided to try my plastic V60 cone that I got off of Amazon with the supposedly shitty tabbed V60 filters that came with my Switch, and... all my brews have been good? Well, I suppose the first one was merely just alright, which was my attempt at the Hoffman method that I sort of bungled, but afterwards I've used [this method I found on Youtube]( and then the [Onyx method]( and I've been consistently getting good quality cups. The taste does vary, of course, which I expected, but they've all been *good*, which is what I considered important. I've just been using a shitty OXO electric burr grinder (set to setting 6 for the first method, and 4 for the Onyx one) and boiling water from a Bonavita gooseneck kettle (set to 98C), as well, and that's been getting me good results. I've been drinking all the coffee black, too. I've just been using Happy Mug Bigfoot Espresso Blend and Illy Decaf, and neither is as fresh as they could be. Maybe my taste buds are just broken? But for me, I haven't made a cup any worse than the Clever Dripper did, and some of them have been even better. There's been no bitterness and they've all had good flavor, though I will admit I'm not too great at tasting notes or anything like that. But even just looking at the front page, at topics that are currently there right now, a lot of other people are having woes with the V60 that I just... don't seem to be having, and I'm not sure why, especially as a beginner. Granted, I've not really had other V60 cups to compare it to, as there's not many non-Starbucks cafes within a few miles, and I absolutely hate the burnt taste of their coffee, so all the coffee I drink has been made at home. Are my V60 brews supposed to not taste as good as they do?"

Several months ago when looking for replacements for my old Keurig, an machine I got when I was younger and never used, I got another Keurig called the K-cafe, which was advertised to make lattes and cuppaccinos and froth milk. So, I got that, and then went down this weird rabbit hole of looking for other machines when I realized the “espresso” was really just concentrated coffee, and if I’m being completely honest I was just excited to try making cool designs but realized that Crema is a necessary component to latte art, and the k-cafe fake-espresso has none of that. It’s also a cost issue, since the pods cost a lot. I fixed the cost issue with a refillable pod, but it’s extremely specific on the grind type (for instance, I can’t buy cafe bustelo ground in bulk) but then I just thought, there has to be something that can accepts ground coffee, is instant and convenient like Keurig, and makes both coffee and espresso shots. When I type “coffee+espresso” maker, they all have a traditional drip-coffee machine, and I literally don’t have the time in the day to wait on those to fill up. Tl;dr: looking for a instant ground-to-cup coffee maker that can make real espresso and coffee, allowing me to use regular and fine grounds instead of pods but with same quick convenience. Milk frothed is a plus. Please help me find my perfect coffee machine."

This is the only image I have of the absolute unit. I can remember it was hooked to a double-filtered tap supply and despite having a bunch of different menu settings, was only ever used for regular and decaf coffee. I asked my father and grandmother and both can't remember what brand it was, but that it was acquired in the mid-90s through a restaurant supplier, of whom also delivered to them regular 6-month shipments of Lacas coffee, ketchup/mustard packets, sugar packets, and the usual assortment of pink/yellow/blue sweetener packets to boot.In its lifetime it only ever broke down once, and it was something to do with a manufacturer defect in a seal that led to quite a bit of water on the floor-- covered under service warranty, of course. aside from this, it was a workhorse, and the employees who frequented it had the machine dialed in for a perfect 8oz cup every time (or so says my grandmother). I can partly blame this machine for my love of coffee today, as I was an early enjoyer (for the time) at 8 years old. As a kid with the ADHD type that calmed down with caffeine, coffee was my savior, no matter what it tasted like.Despite the image depicting such, the machine was not coin-op enabled, and the coin/change mechanism was disabled if it had it installed to begin with, something that slips my own memory. I can remember it taking a time to warm up, and I think it used straight-up pre-ground coffee as I do remember the inside having a waste grounds container. However, I can't make out the brand label on the front-top-left to save my life, and my google-fu must be weak in this field as I'm not able to find any images of commercial-grade machines from this era to get even an inkling of what brands to look at. Honestly I'm doing this for nostalgia's sake, to get some better pictures and even a video if it exists. I'm sorry for the graininess of the image, it was taken on a 3.2MP Kodak camera of the time and not on the highest quality setting it could have been. If this looks in any way shape or form familiar to anyone, or if anyone has any clues toward which brand to look at, it would help a lot towards the removal of a headscratcher I've had for a couple of years now.If this isn't the right subreddit to post this in, a recommendation of where to crosspost it would also be beneficial. I don't know if r/cafe would be more proper but it is 4AM and I'm losing sleep over this.&amp;#x200B; Need help identifying commercial single-cup coffee machine from picture taken in 2003."

I also added the zest of the orange.I then used a blade grinder (gasp!) to grind half a cinnamon stick, adding that.

I found the flavor combination to be delicious but when I tried remaking it myself I came across an issue, the maple flavor was to delicate you could hardly taste it and I only got the maple syrup flavor on the back end.After some research, I found that the maple flavor comes from the darker syrups, not only the darker syrups but also syrups extracted from later in the season. I don't use artificial maple syrups and I wouldn't say I buy the top quality since it can get pricey.This being said, I had the idea of maybe adding maple extract to maple syrup itself and then continuing to use it as a syrup for my lattes. Will this add a weird maple flavor to the latte or can this actually enhance the maple flavor of the syrup itself to make it a little more dominate in the final product? Thank you as always to everybody in the community and I hope to hear back Maple Flavored drinks"

Thought I would give an anaerobic coffee a try for something different, after working with a few more conventional single origin coffees, so I ordered some of the ""carlos plazas cinnamon anaerobic"" from black &amp; white. This morning I opened the bag and immediately noticed a very not-coffee smell that was honestly not at all appealing to me. I continued with my morning ritual, measuring out 25g for my usual 400ml v60 pour over, thinking that maybe it would taste different from how it smelled, more appetizing. It did not. I tasted it by itself the first few sips trying to see if I could get any of the flavors. Tasted kind of like someone steeped a soggy pineapple for a few hours in cold brew and then heated it up and took out all the sweetness. I tried to save it thinking maybe it would be better with a bit of milk and sugar but that just made it worse, a funky mix of wilted headache inducing fruitiness and milk. The aftertaste for me was even worse, something that lingered in my nose and throat for several hours after. I found myself having to take out the kitchen waste, the aroma of spent grounds was so pungent to me.I found it so off-putting that I'm wondering if I did something wrong. Do I just not like anaerobic coffee that much? Did I get too adventurous starting out? Is there some trick to brewing anaerobic that I missed? Are they all like that? am I doing anaerobic wrong?"

It's a medium-ish roast Colombian single origin, and it has this distinct bitterness that tastes... soapy. Note: It isn't an issue with my brew method or the cleanliness of my equipment, as these are the only beans that produce this flavor for me. Has anyone else had this experience? It doesn't taste like your typical overextracted bitterness - it really tastes like the bitterness you get from soap. There's a nice fruitiness at the onset, but then it finishes with the bitterness lingering. I imagine it's what people who don't like cilantro taste. Anyway, it's not something I'm concerned about or anything, just thought it was odd and wanted to share. Beans with a ""soapy"" taste?"

I recently tried espresso for the second time today, and I didn't really enjoy it either time. Both times I've tried it have been at the same specialty-coffee-like cafe. It seemed quite unpleasant, and what I think might be astringent, though I'm not 100% sure what that means. I hoped the second time would allow my palate to grow accustomed to it, but seemingly no luck. In my mind this could be due to 1 of 3 different options:1) My sense of taste isn't yet accustomed to the strong flavour, and I need some time to get used to espresso2) I don't like espresso, and should stick to filter coffee and milk drinks3) the cafe doesn't make very good espressoI was wondering if anyone could give any advice to find out which it is, and what to do to enjoy espresso more (or whether I should give up trying!).

I found the flavor combination to be delicious but when I tried remaking it myself I came across an issue, the maple flavor was to delicate you could hardly taste it and I only got the maple syrup flavor on the back end.After some research, I found that the maple flavor comes from the darker syrups, not only the darker syrups but also syrups extracted from later in the season. I don't use artificial maple syrups and I wouldn't say I buy the top quality since it can get pricey.This being said, I had the idea of maybe adding maple extract to maple syrup itself and then continuing to use it as a syrup for my lattes. Will this add a weird maple flavor to the latte or can this actually enhance the maple flavor of the syrup itself to make it a little more dominate in the final product? Thank you as always to everybody in the community and I hope to hear back Maple Flavored Drinks"

Mainly takeout, with maybe 5-10 seats. And also serve coffee. My initial idea was to invest in a decent, lower end espresso machine (Conti CC100), grinder, batch brewer etc. My partner, who has worked as a barista for a few years, would be in charge of serving customers and making coffees. We did realise we'd have to probably hire someone else to help out in FoH. I'm now thinking, however, to only serve batch brew (for now). The thing is, I'd rather avoid the costs of an espresso set-up, the cost of hiring someone else to help at the front, and the possibility that the coffee might not always be the greatest because of time pressure. But with batch brew, my partner could serve, make cups of batch brew, and also help in the kitchen. No other employee needed. Of course, I'd make sure there's space to buy an espresso machine later on, when we're in a certain flow running the business, and we're in a position to hire more people. But for the beginning, I was thinking we could just focus on high quality filter, and give a choice of two roast types (light/medium) - of course having two batch brewers, which I think would still be cheaper than an espresso set up. Would love to hear some thoughts on this, especially from people who really know their coffee. Do you think people will stray away from coming if they know we don't serve espresso based drinks? Do you think the coffee scene is going towards filter? Opening bakery serving coffee - filter only for the beginning? Or invest in espresso/training/staff etc."

I've got the programmed temps at 200F and 208F (208-209F is boiling at my altitude) in the setup and a couple weeks ago I looked and saw the boiler temp at 225! I unplugged the machine and am just now getting around to troubleshooting - and the readout says 220-225F, but the actual temperature of the water is more like 85-90F.  Has anyone encountered this, and how did you solve it? I thought it might be the thermistor, but that shouldn't be possible as the microprocessor/PID should never let the temp go that high. I opened the lid and there isn't any visible sign of damage. I can't read the markings on the thermistor (faded/smudged) so I can't look up the temp curve and test it. I would reset the firmware to default, but I didn't see a way to do that in the manual. I have reached out to Bill Crossland about this, but my last couple attempts to contact him haven't gotten any response (might be just going to spam), but I figured I'd ask here as well.

Since I am just new into this world, I don't want to spend too much money at this moment. Therefore I have decided to go for the Sage the Bambino plus as a machine.I decided to go for the Eureka Mignon Specialita as a grinder. At first I wanted to buy a Sage grinder(because it was cheaper), but I understand now that a Eureka grinder is considerably better. Since I didn't want to spend too much money, I searched for this grinder on marketplace(from the Netherlands). Yesterday I came across the following ad:[The person concerned sells the grinder for 350 euros and indicates that he has been using it for 6 months (he bought it at Koffiewarenhuis.nl). Yesterday I bid 330 euros and he accepted it immediately. I can pick up the grinder tomorrow. I was wondering, before I finally buy it, if this is a good buy? I don't know anything about grinders yet, so I find it difficult to pass judgment on this. Tomorrow I can inspect the grinder before buying it, but I wouldn't know where to look at either. What strikes me is that the sticker which says specialita looks strange. It looks like it is about to fall off or that it has just been glued on. On new devices, but even on older devices, the stickers look much nicer and neater. Or am I totally wrong?  Thank you very much for your help,  Richard Is this grinder a good buy for the price? It is my first one."

Technology to consistently adjust roast size only came about waaay later, so I would guess coffee was roasted very dark. Does anyone know for sure?

When we first started using it, it all worked fine. Recently I have encountered an issue where whatever I do, regardless of grind size or amount of beans there is no pressure at all when using a double shot basket in the portafilter. I thought it may have been an issue with the machine, but have recently found out the single shot basket (not a pressurised basket) works perfectly. I thought I might have messed up the programming at some point so thought I'd try the double shot button using the single basket as a test, which again the pressure was perfect on. The only thing I can find about this is that the quality of beans might affect this, however this is a consistent issue.

Water stayed in the basket as well. Are the baskets faulty? The regular baskets work fine. Definitely realized that my coffee grind is too fine as the shot came out a bit watery and was dripping most of the extraction process. I did notice that a lot of water stays in the regular baskets when using them without coffee. Is this normal? I’m horrible at explaining stuff so hope this all makes sense! New to the espresso world and bought myself a breville bambino plus. I think I’m having issues with the pressurized baskets or maybe it’s the water pressure on the machine?"

However shipping it to Germany where I live will cause a price overhead, I think it would cost around 700 to 750 euro (shipping, customs...etc) instead of the original price based on some forums and that makes me wonder is it still worth it at this price point.  As an alternative I'm looking into these two possible scenarios:1. A premium hand grinder for both styles like the Kinu m47 (but not sure which variant to get though) or 1Zpresso (I don't know why they have soo many variants and also don't know which to pick.) or maybe Helor 101...etc2. An espresso focused electric grinder like the Sette 270 + something like the Knock Aergrind for pour over  My budget for this is around 500 euro, I single dose my coffee every time, and I don't mind hand grinders. so what is your opinion? any worthy grinders I should take a look at better than the above ones? or even a better way to approach this? A combo of espresso focused electric grinder + cheaper hand grinder for pour over, opinions ?"

Sure enough, we're getting extractions in the 17.5% range for most of our coffees outside of a couple so far in our testing.   We're using a Fetco batch brewer with 2.5 liter batch sizes and the exact same brew temp and recipe across the board just to see how everything stacks up. 1:16 ratio.  6:30 total brew time. 200F water tank.   So we have a dark roast that had an extraction yield of 17.7% and then we have two light roasts that are getting 18.9% and 18.3%. The same origin as the dark roast roasted at a medium got a 17.1%. How is it possible that a dark roast is getting a lower extraction yield than light roasts? I understand different origins can be more or less soluble at the same roast level, but a light and dark being that far apart seems odd.   Most coffees are testing at a TDS of between 1.35% and 1.5% which seems low also for a 1:16 ratio. Any input? Curious about these extraction yield results I'm getting. Darker roasts with same brew parameters as light are getting a lower extraction yield..."

I drink my coffee with some sugar and a bit of milk usually.&amp;#x200B;I've a very basic semi-automatic delonghi machine in my other house, where I enjoy drinking some good specialty coffee. My budget is about 800 to 1000$ ideally (I'm in switzerland, so it's roughtly the same in chf).&amp;#x200B;I feel that having access to two different beans would be a good solution, so I could have like a specialty coffee for the espressos and lungos, and another (probably cheaper) coffee for the capuccino's and machiatto's, where using very high end coffee on a daily basis would probably be a waste. But unfortunately it seems it's pretty rare to have that feature. From what I saw with this, I found:\- Mostly the Melitta T Smart or TS, which are pretty similar. I think I found the TS for roughly the same price so would go for this. My issue with this is that as the coffee goes through the same grinder, there would be some leftovers, and if I alternate espresso and a capuccino from both bean selectors, I'll always have a mix of them. And if I need to make a ""empty coffee"" between each, I'll lose so much that it's not worth it, and lose much time\- Siemens Eq.9 S 700. Looks perfect, but much more expensive.

I had a question about the storage of cold brew coffee. My boyfriend and I love making cold brewed coffee at home. We have always preferred our coffee iced vs hot, especially in the summer. Making it ourselves saves a lot of money, which we need to be especially mindful of right now.The recipe I use calls for a ratio of 8oz of coffee per 8 cups of water. When it is prepared, it is diluted with 1 cup of ice and 1/2 cup of water.From what I’ve read, the cold brew concentrate can be stored up to two weeks. What I’m wondering is- does it have to be stored in its concentrated form? Will it lose any flavor if it is stored in its final diluted form? My boyfriend and I are both guilty of going a little heavy on the concentrate. While I’d like to say we should work on our compulsiveness, that’s easier said than done at 8am in the morning. After making a batch of cold brew coffee concentrate, is there any negative implications to storing it in the fridge at full concentration?"

For taste comparison I brewed the same coffee in an AeroPress and as pour-over to my liking. All good.The machine's version was more acidic and lacked flavor. Temperature was already at its maximum setting, so I adjusted grind size to as fine as the machine could handle without stalling and obvious channeling. The result was more flavorful and had less pronounced acidity. While it was still far away from the AeroPress and pour-over, the taste was much improved. Definitely the right direction.I wondered how much coffee the machine used. Maybe it used less and this caused the weakness. Again, for comparison I made an AeroPress with 60g/L (1:17 ratio). I measured both how much coffee I got out and weighed the completely dried puck.On to the machine. I made a coffee (not ""espresso"") with its ""normal strength"" setting, measured the output, dried the puck (yes, I emptied the container before) and weighed the completely dried puck. I then calculated g/L, or the ratio, for both brews.Result: The machine used about 2.5 times as much coffee. Roughly 150g/L or about a 1:7 ratio for ""coffee"".* Is this normal or is the machine defective?* Is the machine's design only capable to extract such a tiny fraction of the flavor compared to other brewing methods due to temperature, grind size, contact time, etc.?* Any idea how I could have invalidated my little experiment?Side notes:* If caffeine has high and fast solubility, that's a lot of caffeine.* That's a lot of $. Super-automatic uses about 150g/L (1:7 ratio) for ""normal strength coffee""?!"

Can it produce a full 40 oz of coffee? 3. How well does the thermal carafe insulate the coffee? Does it fully seal up like a travel mug, or is there always an opening? I ask because I usually brew coffee for myself and my partner in the morning, but she doesn’t usually drink hers until about 2-3 hours after it has been brewed. Would the carafe keep a half pot hot enough vs using a travel mug of some sort? I was also considering trying to grab a refurbished one, if any one has any experience with that.  Thanks!

The first few brews were great, but the rubber seal developed a very sour and unpleasant smell, which resulted in the brews tasting fun as well. I ordered another seal from a different manufacturer with a high user rating and good reviews, still, after only a day or 2 it developed the same awful sour rubber smell.  I posted about it on r/Aeropress and they told me to try not washing it with soap. Well, a third seal is on it's way, but in the meantime I received my Hario Switch yesterday. It too has developed the same disgusting sour rubber coffee smell on the rubber base. I haven't used soap on it ever, and I got it just yesterday.  At this point I'm left to conclude something is happening between the water, coffee, and the rubber. I have noticed my main problem that occurs with any method is too acidic coffee. I can make an acceptable brew in a French Press, or Pour-Over, but once the rubber is involved it's pretty much impossible. Even several of the cafe's in my town I find the coffee to be far too acidic.  So I'm guessing it's a water issue, or at least the water is a big factor. The water is very hard here 400-600ppm). I tried a zero water filter, which lasted less than 2 days. That simply is not viable for me. I've ordered some water ph strips so I'll see tomorrow how that turns out.  I'm willing to settle for the best I can do with hard water, but the acidity seems to be a persistent problem, and using the rubber equipment makes it undrinkable.  The coffee beans are good, the soap is not the issue. I've tried cleaning the rubber with vinegar, baking soda, soap, peroxide, sunshine etc (separately).  I guess what I'm wondering is if any of you here have experienced a similar issue, and hopefully have a solution to the water acidity, a method to clean the nastiness out of the rubber, or some information about something I'm missing here.

I posted about it on r/Aeropress and they told me to try not washing it with soap. Well, a third seal is on it's way, but in the meantime I received my Hario Switch yesterday. It too has developed the same disgusting sour rubber coffee smell on the rubber base. I haven't used soap on it ever, and I got it just yesterday.   At this point I'm left to conclude something is happening between the water, coffee, and the rubber. I have noticed my main problem that occurs with any method is too acidic coffee. I can make an acceptable brew in a French Press, or Pour-Over, but once the rubber is involved it's pretty much impossible. Even several of the cafe's in my town I find the coffee to be far too acidic.  So I'm guessing it's a water issue, or at least the water is a big factor. The water is very hard here 400-600ppm). I tried a zero water filter, which lasted less than 2 days. That simply is not viable for me. I've ordered some water ph strips so I'll see tomorrow how that turns out.   I'm willing to settle for the best I can do with hard water, but the acidity seems to be a persistent problem, and using the rubber equipment makes it undrinkable.  The coffee beans are good, the soap is not the issue. I've tried cleaning the rubber with vinegar, baking soda, soap, peroxide, sunshine etc (separately).  I guess what I'm wondering is if any of you here have experienced a similar issue, and hopefully have a solution to the water acidity, a method to clean the nastiness out of the rubber, or some information about something I'm missing here.

After 5 mins, maybe a quarter of the beans will be grinded so I switched the settings to finer and overtime it did it’s job.My biggest question is, is there a way to start from 0 or reset how fine/coarse the setting is. Should I turn it clockwise until I can’t go further and work my way through the clicks backwards? I’m just trying to make sure my burrs stay sharp and I don’t damage them or something like the manual says.And what’s the science behind coarser and finer grounded beans, is there a rate difference?

I'm not against it, since it's extremely easy to use. Otherwise, my sister probably wouldn't brew her coffee. And I also benefited from it for years. Especially for straining cold brew coffee...But it's filtering the coffee too much. I guess those extremely fine grounds that only paper filter can strain gives a taste I prefer.The machine also somehow has moods and it never brews the same coffee twice, I think, but that's a different story 🤣Thanks to James Hoffman, I learned about cupping, after benefiting from his french press video. I don't usually test coffee, but after trying test comparison between a few cups, I noticed that the cups had actually drinkable coffee. There was a large sediment at the bottom, of course, but if I just drink the liquid layer, it was actually a normal and enjoyable coffee.Recently, I started to brew only with this. It's extremely easy, almost as easy as instant coffee. And it tastes significantly better than the paper filter, for my taste. And no additional dishes to wash, unlike french press with a difficult to clean fine mesh.I also liked to brew with Turkish coffee method before. It was similar, meaning no straining. But decanting(pouring very slowly) the coffee with the Turkish coffee pot(jazwa) gave unexpectedly clean cups. Even better than french press sometimes.So I'm now mixing this with cupping. I have a glass tea brewing pot with a large bottom. So it's very suitable for decanting.I pour the coffee into the cup, after mixing it slowly at 4 mins. I don't want to disturb fine grounds that would settle later, so I let them settle in the cup, instead of the pot. They are not too much, so this doesn't concern me.I sometimes use a coarse strainer during pouring, just to catch the floating coarse grounds and chaffs. But it's not necessary.The cups are significantly cleaner than cupping alone. And even though I dirtied one additional dish, the glass pot is very easy to clean. I'm really enjoying this method now.TL, DR: I like the things in the coffee that the paper filters strain. I also like simpler methods(thus, ""the best part is no part""). So I started brewing with cupping and it was what I was looking for. Then I started brewing in a large bottom tea pot (the image/link above) and slowly pouring into the cup, and this simple addition gave significantly cleaner cups, while still being simple. So I'm really enjoying this method above other methods.Ps: I made an electric screwdriver adapter for my Porlex grinder 🤣 I don't know if it will heat the grounds too much, but it's being fine for one cup grinding.Note that I made a lower quality adapter years ago but the tolerances were too bad and it didn't last long. So I used Torx head and tight tolerances this time, and it's going well. The screw bit was a bit rusty, so I did hot bluing and cooled it in leftover sunflower oil, that I was using for season coating pans. So it probably also has a thin polymer coating. I think it will be rust free now. ""The best part is no part"": Cupping gave me my favorite coffee and I added a decanting step to have it cleaner"

He was a great guy and an amazing roaster.  I never had to worry about roasting dates, everything was always very fresh.

I've been ordering bags from a number of places and have noticed that while the better places will put a ""Roasted On"" date, others will have the dreaded ""Best Before"" date.We've probably beaten to death the uselessness of these dates but I've noticed something new.

I thought that was lame until I ordered some beans from another local roaster and they were labeled with a BB date that was 5.5 months out.Is a six month window a thing now?  I get that it is challenging to maintain stock in supermarkets, but this makes it really hard to know when the coffee was roasted.  What are you guys seeing out there?

Basically, I had to do it for a couple of nights. I had no other options except to take some work home and finish all the reports at night after dinner when everyone was asleep. &amp;#x200B;To be honest, I find working at nocturnal hours very satisfying -- you are on your own, no one bothers you, and you can focus on work without getting distracted by any other problems, text messages, and phone calls. You are just on your own with your thoughts and your work. Sometimes, I look in the window or go on the terrace at my house for a small break. Before that, I brew a delightful coffee. Recently, I've got a coffee press. I didn't want to wake everyone around with our noisy espresso machine. It also makes a good coffee, but the noise wakes everyone before the delightful scent reaches them.&amp;#x200B;So, I'm trying to master the skill of making a delightful coffee in a French press. I'm doing pretty well so far. I even noticed that coffee prepared in a French press is more aromatic than an espresso machine coffee. Maybe the technique plays a key role in the brewing process, or our espresso machine is a bit outdated. Who knows, but this aroma used to wake my family at night. Still, I try to be quiet and careful because I like to watch the starry sky and enjoy my drink.&amp;#x200B;But, this coin has another side. I struggle to fall asleep when I'm done with the work with all this caffeine. Then I struggle to wake up at night. Everything is twisted for me right now, and I feel lost when it is day and time to go to sleep. I know that the best solution is to consume less caffeine. I'm asking for some decaf sorts of coffee but with a pleasant taste and aroma. I wonder how many of you also like to drink coffee at night? How many of you also like to drink coffee at night?"

I want to see if this is even possible for my situation to begin with.I own a small coffee company in the Bay Area of California. We currently sell coffee bags but are looking to expand into a mobile cart. We would like to build a utility cart into a setup that sells ready to drink drip coffee and cold brew, accompanied with oat and almond milk in a Zojirushi pot, with extra plant-based milk in a cooler full of ice. We don't want to bring any dairy because of the risk of it spoiling and not having the necessary permits. Dairy is more of a liability than anything for our setup. As far as preparing the coffee goes, we would like to use commercial perculators to prepare large amounts of drip coffee that we will fill into a 5 gallon cambro. Cold brew would be prepared in a large Toddy cold brew bucket, and we would fill it into another 5 gallon cambro. Oat milk and almond milk would be setup ready to pour in a Zojirushi pot, and syrups, sugars, napkins, stirrers will be ready to go in case someone wants them. I know I need to obtain a seller's permit, health permit, and vehicle permit for my cart. My biggest question is can I get away with brewing the coffee in my own kitchen? People often use commercial kitchens when it comes to preparing food but coffee is something that can be so simply made your own house. Also, if I build my cart using a utility cart and simply sell ready to pour coffee, will I need a handwashing sink? California is one of those states that has the most insane laws when it comes to any type of mobile food setup. If you have any comments, advice, or knowledge about this subject please share! Looking to start a mobile coffee cart in California, please help!"

It was a 'like new' unit from Amazon but seems literally spotless.I'm following the guide produced by James Hoffman, so I'm following his process, stopping the brew at the first signs of sputtering:.I'm filling the basket of My 6-cup moka pot with freshly ground coffee (not too fine) and topping it off without packing it down. .I'm filling the boiler with boiling water to just below the valve, assembling the pot and sticking it on a low-medium gas heat. .I'm watching the pot, and as it begins to produce a steady stream of coffee I turn the heat to low. .When it begins to sputter, I remove from heat and run the unit under cold water until sputtering stops.The pot is way less than half filled with coffee at this point, and splitting it between two normal coffee mugs (from the UK for reference) produces what I'd describe as two puddles of coffee. With milk, it makes two half-mugs of strong, tasty coffee. When cleaning the unit, it seems like half the water is still in the boiler, and murky brown.What is going wrong here? If this was a two pot machine I'd say happy days, but the idea of spreading this amount of coffee across six servings is... Well, it can't be possible, unless Italian coffee is traditionally served via Petrie dish. Am I some kind of cultureless moron serving out two triple strength coffees? Are Italian cups a lot smaller than I think they are?Or am I doing something stupid that is causing the pot to spurt way earlier than it should? I inspect the grounds afterwards and there is no sign of channeling and all the grounds are moist. I checked the gasket too, it seems in good shape- the metal filter it is holding in place is loose enough to rotate but does not wobble.I've tried the pot about eight times now trying not to vary my method, and have produced the same results every time so far.Thanks to anyone that could point me in the right direction with this, even if it is 'expect less coffee'! 6-cup bialetti moka producing tiny amount of coffee. what am I doing wrong?"

[Here's couple of pictures]( of how it looks like afterwards.The way I see it I either need to reduce the inflow of water, or increase the time water uses to pass the filter. The latter is likely the place to start. The flow of water through the filter is heavily redeced by the filter, to a - I believe - much greater extent than my previous filter coffee machines, so it seem like there's something about the design of the cup holding the filter causing the water to pass through very slowly. So, is there a way to increase the rate of which the water flows through the coffee filter? How to increase water flow through the filter in filter coffee machine"

I know that was only a thing on the Plus before, but I picked mine up from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and was surprised to see both included with it. A 16oz Milk pitcher and 4 baskets (2 pressurized, 2 non-pressurized). **Review**After researching the big bois like the Rancilio &amp; Gaggia Classic, gotta say it feels amazing not to spend that much money on those. PID and instant startup were the big features that got me not to buy those two. The moment people started talking about ""temperature surfing"" I was out, all I care about is a pretty nice cup of coffee with milk and a little sugar, iced or hot. Took like 9 failed batches with the Breville Smart Grinder but I finally got it dialed in. The espresso tastes great! I don't drink it straight, either Americano or Latte. I tried to take that plastic part of the portafilter off but I just couldn't, but the coffee tastes fine and no weird plastic taste. I was thinking of getting those expensive tamp/distributors, but honestly that cheap-ass plastic tamp that comes with it works just fine. The steam wand is loud AF, sounds like hellspawn being fried alive by the sun and screaming for mercy. I can't tell if it's just my bad technique or I'll have to deal with that every time I froth milk, but it seriously hurts my ears. My dog hates it lol. Honestly from a convenience standpoint, this thing is amazing and I don't see myself upgrading for years. The fact that I can roll out of bed and make an espresso within the next 5 mins is insane. I know r/espresso probably hates me but to those who are stressing out over your next machine or grinder, looking at the $400-800+ minimums for each that redditors claim you have to spend, this $300 machine has me perfectly satisfied as someone who just likes 'good' coffee and doesn't need 'best in class' at home. The mental stress I didn't know I had about having to get the super expensive 'entry-level' gear is all gone and it feels wonderful.If you have any questions about it, lemme know and I'll be happy to answer them.

And do you have any ideas about oils I could use to varnish the wood that doesn't go rancid or have a taste? Linseed oil seems applicable because it doesn't go rancid but is bitter so idk what to use.)I recently acquired an antique Peugeot coffee grinder at a flea market. It is in quite good condition for the price (20€) so I wanted to try to restore it. There is rust on the handle that I removed by sanding but I don't know how to properly clean the burrs. As there is some rust around the burrs but not on the parts that actually grind the beans, I was tempted to soak it in vinegar and salt (to remove rust according to some web articles). However I also read that putting any liquid on the burrs would decrease their efficiency and was generally bad. Any suggestions? My other issue is dealing with the wood. It's quite old but in good condition, though coffee has been sitting there for a long time. That's why I wanted to try to sand it a bit with fine grit and then varnish it with something. The issue is that either the products are not food safe, either it can be done using oils that get rancid over time or that bring a bad taste. I thought of using linseed oil but it seems to be bitter at taste so idk if this will have any consequences on the end cup. It's my first time posting there so I hope I'm doing things the right way ^^Anyway thank y'all for helping me in advance!!

Therefore the percolation brew in the cup would have a higher strength with the same ration compared to immersion.Im not sure whether that explains the recommendation. Is there another reason i didn't think of? Brewing Ratios - immersion vs. Percolation

Flavour is like rich and nutty to the point where everyone in the office smells it and leaves positive comments when I take it in a flask to work.Recently for some reason it has taken a minute or two longer to come out of the spout, which makes it taste a little more bitter/sour than I’d like but still OK. Remember hearing you’re supposed to use boiling water to avoid that, but in the past that caused the coffee to taste completely sour so I just stuck to cold water usually. Today I tried mostly cold water but with a dash of boiling water and it came out in 9 mins instead. Let me tell you, the coffee this time around has got to be the cleanest, lightest cup I’ve ever brewed in my life. It doesn’t even have that strong nutty smell anymore, it’s more subtle, and it has a kind of smoothness similar to tea. Honestly don’t know what I like more lol the 10 minute one is almost rich like chocolate, the 9 minute one is kinda refreshing. N.B.: I usually brew the pot then add it to a mug/flask with more boiling water and a dash of cardamom. Experiences with the moka pot"

I know nothing about specialty coffee except that I do love espresso and mainly want to make my own mochas without going out to coffee shops. It's just me at home so I don't need anything really fancy. I am looking at the Nespresso machines because I'm hearing that they create the best flavor. I have a budget of about $140 for a machine &amp; an additional $30-40 for a protection plan. My questions about choosing a machine:1. Is my budget too low? I am looking at going through Amazon (which I know some people hate) because I have Prime and always get good customer service with them in case of problems.2. What is the ""original"" machine(s)? I was told the pods are the best and cheapest. I don't know if I can make mochas with this one though. I'd like to make mochas most of all.3. Is Nespresso the best choice for me? I'd like the convenience of pods but being able to also use my own coffee would be more budget-friendly.4. I have looked at other machines but don't know if they are worth it. What about machines like the Chef Wave and other espresso makers?5. Are there universal/reusable pods for the Nespresso or the other ""good"" machines?6. I'm looking at making 1 mocha a day (occasionally 2). I expect to spend about $35 for coffee pods (if I can't use my own grounds).7. I have a milk frother already.So, basically, I want a machine that makes good coffee without it being a complicated process. I want something very simple to use and not too hard on the wallet for buying the coffee.Talk to me like I'm not the brightest 5 year old. This appliance is going to cost a lot (for me) but coffee is my one real pleasure these days. Need a ""for dummies"" version for choosing a machine"

During this time, which began when I was 27, I started with mochas...I enjoyed the dark chocolate flavor and how it mixed with the bitter espresso.   Like many of us, I eventually graduated to Americanos (they're cheaper), then black coffee, then straight espresso shots.   The work environment was extremely stressful, fast-paced, and busy, and we usually earned about $15k-$18k/wk at our peak with a skeleton crew of never more than 6 baristas, total, on the schedule (including the lead).   If we had to work 6 days a week to keep it open, that was just tough. During this time, I realized as I got older, I couldn't keep up with the pace.   So I did what we all do, got my Xanax prescription increased, and started pounding more and more shots so I could keep up.   My boss was not understanding of anything less than excellence, and I was convinced she deserved it.   It was unacceptable and *weak* to not be 100% ""on"" in the workplace.   My doctor started to advise me that my anxiety, heart rate, and bowel movements were all being negatively impacted, but I brushed it off.   This was *caffeine"" we're talking about...its not a serious drug.About 5 years in, I developed interstitial cystitis.   It took me 2 years to get a diagnosis.    Caffeine is a horrible trigger for this condition, but I gave up orange juice and other trigger foods and decided I'd double down on coffee.   I can't do my job if I don't drink coffee after all.    And it was *unprofessional* not to be a coffee drinker and work at Starbucks.   After about 8 or 9 years, my anxiety began to seriously increase in intensity.   Angry outbursts happened with customers, co-workers, anyone who I could lash out at, because my resting heart rate was now well above 100.   But I'd done this so long, I don't know how to do any other job.   Starbucks is the way.   So I just decided ""no cold brew,"" and kept on.11 years in, I was hospitalized.   The ER doctor said I had ""caffeine intoxication.""   ""A toxic amount of caffeine is in your blood.    Have you been consuming more than 250mg a day?""   I laughed.   ""It's *easily* upwards of 500.""   He grimaced, but I laughed it off.   I'd just taper it down, do half-caff.   I wasn't addicted I could quit whenever I want.   Meanwhile, I developed nasty case of IBS.At year 12, I had a mental breakdown.   Starbucks consumed my every waking thought, and I knew if I left leadership there it would soon fall apart.   But I finally got the courage to tell my boss I couldn't handle the pressure anymore.   It was my anxiety, you see.  My coffee intake continued.    A year later, I asked for a transfer out of Starbucks.   Now, I'll quit, I said.I didn't for at least 2 years.   I developed nasty acid reflux, which I'm medicated for morning and night.It's now 5 days ago.   I didn't have a bowel movement for over 48 hours.     The doctor said ""you have done significant damage over time to your bowel system with your coffee intake, and if you don't quit caffeine, it won't get better.""   He prescribed me several fine products that I'm now using, and I made the decision there:   the only way for me to break the addiction to coffee...was to go cold turkey.   Tapering off always resulted in me falling off the wagon again.   (Continued) My Coffee Addiction/Withdrawal Journey"

First I used whatever crap beans from Lidl I happened to have in the cupboard and no matter how I adjusted it the end result was just very sour and borderline undrinkable. Raising temperature and setting a finer grind helped but not enough. I was hoping I'll get better results with some better beans and I got a new bag of quality beans and I couldn't tell absolutely no difference, still very sour borderline undrinkable coffee. Went through the whole bag of beans just trying different settings and nothing really helped.Then got another bag of espresso beans which were marked as having low acidity and then I followed Hoffmann's guide where he suggests setting grind to around the midrange/stock and just leaving it there, then measure dry grind weight (which was about 13.7 g on this machine with ""extra-strong taste"" setting) and then adjust extracted coffee to around 1:4 ratio and try increasing amount of coffee. I tried 55-&gt;85 g range of extracted coffee but don't really notice a big difference. Maybe the taste gets a tiny bit blander and very tiny bit more bitter? These beans were clearly a big difference though, now the end result is definitely way less acidic and at least drinkable. I am still quite disappointed though... Any suggestions what I could try?

I’ve been using the Gaggia Classic Pro for some time and I am now ready to invest in a more professional espresso machine for my new appartment. Ideally, I would like to keep this new machine for many years and in some near future also plumb it directly to a water source. This is why I’m looking at purchasing an espresso machine with a rotary pump. The design of this machine is very important to me as I want it to be the piece of resistance of my apartment. After conducting my research, I’ve narrowed down my options to 4 machines, two Rocket and two ECM models (one HX and one dual boiler per brand), which all seem to perform great. Unfortunately, I’m still hesitating between the models below and I can find a proper recommendation online. I’m not sure if I should invest the extra money and get a dual boiler machine or if one brand is generally better than the other.These are the models I’m currently looking at:- Rocket Mozzafiato Evo R (~1,840 USD)- Rocket Cinquantotto (~2,333 USD)- ECM Technika V PID (~2,287 USD)- ECM Synchronika (~2,687 USD)I prefer to stick the same coffee beans and will probably not experiment as much as others with frequently changing beans. I drink about two coffees a day, usually a latte in the morning and an espresso after lunch. I also like to invite my family and neighbors to a cup of coffee every now and then. So I don’t expect to make more than 4 coffee drinks per day.Which model would you choose? Would you go against one of these and if so why? Dual boiler or HX for a home setup? Rocket or ECM?Thanks a ton!Current setup: Gaggia Classic Pro (with various mods) and a Eureka Mignon Specialita. Rocket vs ECM, HX vs Dual Boiler - Which one to choose?"

Anyway, here's what the cleaning of my current one includes:\- cleaning the nozzle of frother is fine, it takes me just a couple of seconds  \- the tray for the ground coffee waste is more annoying, but because it is not just about throwing it out, but about a mold already forming in it, so each time it requires a full clean with a dish soap etc.\`; draining the water tray is fine, at least there isn't any mold there  \- whether a weekly or monthly interior cleaning (including the brewing unit) is a nightmare, I open the compartment door and there is coffee and mold everywhere - my favorite part are all the crevices with a stuck moldy coffee - cleaning this is about 30-60 minutes ceremony and four stages of cleaning (wet wipe, dish soap clean, dry wipe, rubbing alcohol cleaning of the stubborn stuck coffee/mold).Has anyone have any experience with more expensive Philips/Saeco or Siemens models?

One or max 2 stores offer it, so it makes doing ""smart"" decisions lot harder. But then I stumbled upon this store ""Caffe Italia"". And they seemed to have great deal on the same machine I was looking to get, Gaggia Classic Pro. Quick browse around the internet, lead me to believe they might ship a machine atleast, if I paid with my credit card, the risk would be relatively low. I would just let my credit card company handle the plausible issues, and I would mod the gaggia anyways, so bad warranty was kinda expected. But while doing the order, I mistyped my card info, which resulted in order failing (transaction didn't go through) but order still processed? Idk what happened, its kinda buggy. But I left the customer support a message, on what happened.It took them few days to respond, but they still did. In their email they just stated that ""just order it again"", and thats about it. The thing is, they responded 5 hours after their ""opening hours"", yeah, its probably out sourced, as everything is. But kinda shady in my opinion. Hard to imagine their support staff is working 10pm on a friday night, support hours listed on site is 10-16. Language was also pretty bad, probably worse than google translated, so probably 2 rounds of google translate? Then I went around and started looking around trust pilots. I don't know how I missed it on my initial sweep, but atleast entire finnish trustpilot site is botted, with obvious grammar mistakes on every review. Also almost like they are arguing the bad ones. Entire reason I'm typing this out now, is so people can find a post stating that this site is pretty shady. Everything on the internet seems to be just spammed with positive stuff, to hide the bad and honest stuff.Search term ""Caffe Italia Reddit"", etc obvious experience thread tags are covered in non related posts. Can't prove they are trying to hide it, but wouldn't be out of ordinary for them it seems like... They also list their HQ to be in Finland/what ever portal of their site you look at. All just trying to make it seem more legit.Also, if I'm wrong about them, on my initial impressions, you are free to prove me wrong. Share your expriences here, and I'll gladly delete this post. TLDR: This store is doing some very shady stuff, with obvious review botting. Even if they deliver on their products, I can't imagine plausible warranty support even existing. [Gear] Caffe Italy / Coffee Italy, is a very shady store, and people should proceed with caution."

What I’m not sure about is if I want to extract moreFrom the beans, should I let the crust stay longer? Or break the crust sooner and let the coffee settle at the bottom? Does more coffee extract from the crust, or from settled coffee? I think I understand the variables of temp and grind size, but not the crust/settled aspect. Thank you for your knowledge!

I just got a Hario Buono 1L kettle and was surprised to learn when I got it home that you can't actually boil 1L (or even 750ml, which is what I use for french press) of water in it: to reach the advertised 1L capacity, you have to fill the kettle up to the tippy-top, meaning that you can't even put the lid on without water overflowing the kettle. I tried to boil just 750ml of water in it and the lid popped off and the kettle boiled over before it even got to a rolling boil. So the 1L capacity, while technically accurate, is kind of useless when the kettle is actually used for its express purpose of boiling water.Hario makes a 1.2L version but based on my experience with the 1L version, I'm not confident that the extra 20% capacity will prevent boil-over, and most other manufacturers of nice stainless kettles make versions right around 1L capacity.So, are there any nice induction-compatible stainless steel gooseneck kettles that you know for a fact can actually hold 1L (or even 800ml, which is the most I'd ever use at once) of boiling water without boiling over? Induction-compatible stainless gooseneck kettle that can actually hold 800ml of boiling water?"

Here's what I've come up with. Imagine a graph with X and Y axis, and in the middle is the theoretical perfect cup. (Not objective, but according to your taste.) One axis would represent strength, and the other, extraction. A coffee that tasted strong, but too acidic or salty might be a high strength, low extraction brew. One that tasted weak and a little subdued or flat would be low strength, high extraction. All you would have to do is draw your graph axis and make a mark for how you thought the coffee tasted. The closer to your ideal balance, the better. It was inspired partly by some recent Ārāmse videos about coffee logging and their coffee recipe builder system, and also by a plugin I use in my recording software that uses two axis (axes?) to balance EQ.

However, while I'd love to own a big-boy espresso machine and go nuts every morning making cortados and flat whites for my family while shouting about grind size and extraction rates at my neighbours, I am currently relying on a moka pot to get me as close to a tasty espresso type drink at home as I can without dropping major $$$.   I've followed Hoffman's moka technique and I can get a consistently delicious strong brew, but without a proper steam wand, I am largely limited to an Aerolatte hand frother, which is actually pretty good at getting a decent microfoam in heated full-fat milk. Not perfect, since it requires a few iterations of froth/shake down stir/froth some more so that the few larger bubbles pop and the milk gets a bit more uniform, but the final result is totally acceptable.One thing I've experimented with (and I was wondering if anyone has thoughts on) is adding evaporated milk in a 1:3 ratio to full fat milk before heating and frothing in order to get some more velvety thickness in the milk foam, along with a sweeter and richer taste. I'm guessing that the evaporation and heating process involved with evaporated milk does something chemically to the milk proteins that is similar to the effect steam has on the flavour of regular milk, but I honestly don't know what, other than that it's a definite improvement over just plain milk.   Would appreciate any nerdy ideas about what might be happening here, and if there's any other tweaks that you guys would recommend :) Frothed milk tweaks with evaporated milk for moka pot espresso style drinks"

understand freshly roasted aromatics rested nevertheless still need rest carbon dioxide byproduct roasting interferes extraction see would issue drip style espresso pour given limited contact time also problem immersion style extraction method turkish french press far see carbon dioxide may interfere extraction initially length contact would overcome initial difficulty extraction case brew immediately maximize aromatics resting matter immersion method,0,781,128,"So from what I understand, freshly roasted coffee has more aromatics than rested coffee, but the coffee nevertheless still needs to rest because the carbon dioxide byproduct of roasting interferes with extraction. While I can see how this would be an issue for drip style coffee, espresso, and pour overs given the limited contact time with water, is it also a problem for immersion style extraction methods such as Turkish coffee or French press? As far as I can see, the carbon dioxide may interfere with extraction initially, but then the length with which water is in contact with the coffee would overcome any initial difficulties in extraction, in which case you should brew with the coffee immediately to maximize aromatics. Does resting coffee matter for immersion methods?"

Like many, I used to douse my coffee with milk and sugar. I drank the whole menu at Starbucks and couldn't imagine drinking something black. Instead, I needed it milky like the sun and would impress my barista friends at the number of pumps of sugar I used. I used to be the person that would put a quarter of drizzle in my Starbucks Caramel Macchiato. Now, being 28 years old, I don't drink coffee everyday, but when I do, I drink it black. It's taken me a long time to enjoy coffee this way, and I think anyone can learn to drink it black as well. It just takes small incremental changes, and a desire to change.Where I started: I used to be the kid that put 10 pumps of classic, or sugar in my cup. Any drink, you name it. I needed a quarter-cup of cream, and at least 3-4 packets of sugar, Splenda, Equal etc. I couldn't imagine why anyone would want hot bean water. I saw coffee as a drink to energize. At the time, I was working at Starbucks, so I had the sugar and milk and cream to my disposal.I eventually got a job in a third-wave coffee shop and anyone that knows coffee, now knows Starbucks is a terrible cup of coffee. It's good for a pinch and social status, for carrying that white-green mermaid cup, but if you want good coffee, you go to a third-wave coffeeshop and café. I'm talking about Irving Farm, Blue Bottle, Hungry Ghost, etc. Sugar is by far the easiest thing to let go. Just reduce your intake by a quarter. You'll hardly notice and especially if you're pairing your cup of coffee to a pastry or meal, you definitely won't miss it. Cream just does magical things to coffee. It makes it turn milky-white, and silky-smooth on your tongue. And that's exactly why you need to remove it. Around this time, I started to drink black tea black, without milk or sugar. I got stuck on the cream, no-sugar phase for a while. I recently started to take a sip of my coffee before I would drop in cream. Like an ode to coffee, or a tribute, I would taste the first sip black, before I added cream. Stuck on this phase for a while. Eventually, I just got lazy. I would still take that first sip. Sometimes I would add cream. Other times, I'd get too busy and forget I had the coffee, but I would chug it down. Happened too many times to me.Then one day, I just started to drink it black. I didn't enjoy it, but I would make a face after every sip. Like drinking a shot of alcohol, I would purge and gawk. If you ever drink coffee black, you know it's most bitter at it's highest temperature. So one day, I started to experiment. I'd let it cool to warm or room-temperature. That did the trick.Today, I'm cream-free, sugar-free and loving it. Coffee is a ritual and part of my day, but I enjoy it black. I didn't think I could ever get here, from 10-pumps of sugar, to cream no-sugar, to now, black.This was 3-years in the making. I'm now free. That being said, time to make a cup. I've learnt to now drink coffee black, and gawk at milk or sugar."

Options for chocolate, and what I can only assume is coffee creamer.I've been gaining weight and can't figure out why when my diet has been stable. I realized this selection I'm using must be coffee creamer (I didn't know what it was before a few weeks ago). And I've been basically drinking 1 4oz shot + 10oz coffee creamer once or twice a day for 4 days a week for months. Normally I take it easy on the sugar, like a lot.

My wife and I have a nespresso vertuo at home, which was really more of something my wife was using, but toward the beginning of the pandemic, I started drinking more coffee from the nespresso (mostly because it was really easy to order the pods, while getting anything else at the time was more difficult.)One of the things I like about tea is the absolutely massive number of tea choices you can explore, as well as a lot of the ritual that can be involved in brewing a nice cup of tea.  The nespresso doesn't really offer that, so I started looking further into what's out there for coffee.I started out with a V60 and a Krups electric burr grinder.  My wife had bought a french press in the past, and I also ended up buying an aeropress.With the french press and aeropress I've been able to make pretty decent coffee, and sometimes can make a good cup of coffee with the V60, but it kind of seems hit or miss, sometimes ending up a bit sour or bitter, or both.  I also keep getting this ""paper"" flavor.  At first I thought it was coming from the paper filters I'm using, but then I realized I was tasting it when I wasn't using a filter as well.I just bought a 1zpresso jx pro (I spent a bunch of time debating between the various timemore and 1zpresso grinders, and eventually decided to go with this one,) which, to be fair, is 3x the cost of the krups, but the grind is so much more consistent.  I honestly wasn't expecting there to be that big of a difference in the flavor, but my pour overs have just been really nice using the new grinder.  No sourness, just ever so slightly on the edge of becoming bitter, which I'm assuming if I dialed up one more click would go away, none of the ""paper"" flavor I was getting with the Krups.  The flavor of the coffee seems more rounded (not sure how to better describe it.) And the coffee actually seems to have a bit more body as well, it's a really nice mouthfeel.The water is also running through the coffee much slower, which I was worried about at first, thinking I was going to end up over-extracting the coffee, but it really wasn't.The biggest problem I'm having with the new grinder is that it takes almost a minute of manually turning the crank to get enough grounds for the pour over, which I guess I'll get used to. Was using a cheap electric grinder, bought a slightly more expensive hand grinder, and damnit, the coffee from the hand grinder is actually better..."

I tend to get more interesting cups with my Aeropress or V60 though, so I think I need to work on my recipe/extraction.I pretty much do what James Hoffmann recommends in his video. So: Water -&gt; Coffee -&gt; stir to wet all the grounds -&gt; 2mins -&gt; stir/shake to break the crust -&gt; 30sec -&gt; draw down.To change the end result I can think of the following variables: ratio, water temperature, grind, steep time, agitation. I'm pretty happy with the strength of the coffee I get. I usually go for something like 65-70g per liter of water. As I use mostly light roasts I tend to brew with boiling water (or close to boiling, as there's some temperature loss due to starting with the water). With more medium roasts I drop it a couple of degrees. Steep time seems to only barely increase extraction in immersion or steep and release brews.So what's left is grind and agitation. From what I can vaguely remember, with immersion brews, agitation has more significant of an effect than a finer/coarser grind. Because there's a percolation phase though, I would assume that the grind is more significant than in a French Press for example.Of course I'm constantly trying out stuff myself, but I'd be interested to know what your experiences have been and how you've successfully adjusted the extraction with the Clever. How do you guys dial in your Clever Dripper brews?"

When i have a cup of coffee, i just feel shaky, anxious, and my heart feels like it wants to jump out of my ribcage. Just about recently, i had two big cups of coca cola and then wanted to go for a walk. For some amount of time it was bearable, but when it started to get quite warm in the sun, all of a sudden, my pulse started going way up to the point where i even got dizzy so i had to sit down for a while, until i had calmed down a bit. I feel like it wasn't always like this, though. This changed when i once had chewing tobacco in high school and felt extremely sick afterwards from the nicotine. After this event, i now feel like i perceive the caffeine a lot stronger. I always felt it being strong, but i was able to drink a cup of coffee and not feel this bad. Although maybe I feel like the caffeine is stronger now because in my opinion, the effect that nicotine had on me was quite similar to caffeine to me. So maybe, because i associate this effect with feeling bad, it causes me to freak out slightly. Anyways, how can i continue to enjoy coffee as someone who is caffeine sensitive? I don't think that getting used to caffeine is a good option as i tried this not too long ago by drinking coffee once every day for a month and had only gotten used to the effect slightly. how can I enjoy coffee as a caffeine sensitive Person?"

Yields are the same, about 100g/200g of coffee (+/- 5g)I was surprised how consistent it is, measured between multiple brews. I use a gas stove, always the same (smallest) burner and I use different settings for the 3 and 6 cup (which I can replicate using the numbers of the knob).

I have vials with 18g of coffee and that's about it. I've been grinding with different settings, tamping with difference forces in an attempt to finally hit that ""spot"".Today was that day, 18g in, distributed, tamped, added paper filters above and below the coffee bed, inserted into my machine, pressed go and realized that I was a bit too thin, it took a WHILE to get everything out (should be programmed to pull 50g of liquid).Since I was getting some sour espressos before (since I upped my dose from 16g to 18g) I was okay with it since it looked pretty uniform. After 35~50 seconds it finished, I decided to taste it, since the smell was clean, I didn't feel that ""sour"" smell.I swirled with a tiny spool I have and tasted all the crema that remained at the spool and HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT. it tasted fucking amazing, almost no bitterness, nice finish, and a super strong caramel/nuts flavor.Second spoon was almost the same thing, and after that it all went downhill, turning bitter and bitter by the second.I have no idea if it's possible to get the entire shot to taste like that, but that is something I really wanna try now. Glad I bought a new scale a few days ago, now I just have to wait and try everything again.I need every single tip I can get to replicate this, I need another espresso like that in my life.

I remember going from drip to pour over with “unflavored” coffee and remember being able to taste flavor profiles I didn’t know existed. But with the flavored coffee all I got was a very clean cup of flavored coffee. No bitterness, no muddiness, no astringency, just a really clean cup. Is the hazelnut flavor killing any attempt at genuine coffee sweetness? Is there a “better” way to handle the ground, flavored coffee you buy at a grocery store?My drip technique:Remove carafe, pour water (plus 10 grams) in the tank. Put in paper filter, add coffee. Run machine without carafe, let basket fill up half way and give it a good stir with a spoon.

SO, I'm looking first for brand suggestions and also for storage suggestions. Before I started at my current job I was a manager at McDonald's for seven years and we made iced coffee daily with our regular brew x2 and stored it in a tank with ice, and at the end of the night we dumped whatever was left. We are a small business here and try not to waste where we can so making a large quantity and keeping it out all day is not something that is really feasible to us. I had thought of brewing coffee regularly, letting it cool and keeping it in the fridge for a certain amount of time. I drink coffee, I love iced coffee myself but I'm not that big of a coffee fiend that I could tell you whether or not a coffee tastes ""old"" or ""burnt"". We pride ourselves on serving really great drinks and want to hit it right. So I'd love to know what you think our best option might be in regards to storage time or if we should brew regularly and just refrigerate.

I’ve tried seemingly everything to get the pressure down and whilst getting the right pour time but nothing seems to work so I’ve just been having pours with the pressure gauge right at the end. Is there a chance of damaging the machine doing this? Or if someone is able to help me diagnose my problem then and get the right amount if pressure and correct pour time then even better! Can consistent high pressure on an espresso machine damage the machine?

I love learning more about things on the side so I thought, *I wonder if there's a course I could do that goes really deep on this stuff?* And naturally after some research I found the Q Grader Certification. But that's for really serious professionals, with a high cost and high barrier to entry. I don't want to go that far. But I'm inspired by the breadth of knowledge that's necessary to be certified. I'd love to get maybe half way there purely for fun as a hobbyist, without too much monetary pain or having to take exams. I also don't think the Q Grader course goes too much into different brewing methods (that's not the point) but for the home enthusiast I'd want to focus there too.So with one eye on this [useful course summary I found]( and tweaking substantially for my interests, here's my proposed at-home syllabus:**General coffee knowledge*** Read a well-regarded book about each of: cultivation / harvesting, processing, cupping, roasting and brewing.* Solid understanding of the impact of bean origin.* Solid understanding of the coffee supply chain and cost / pricing mechanisms (I'm an econ nerd), including both commodity grade and specialty coffee.* Put James Hoffmann's *The World Atlas of Coffee* on my bookshelf so people know I mean business.**Roasting*** Buy a roaster, burn a bunch of beans, then stop burning them and actually start roasting well.* Solid understanding of and ability to identify roasting defects.* Ability to roast various origins and varietals to the correct roast levels. **Cupping / Tasting*** Comprehensive understanding of the various cupping protocols.* Solid understanding of the impact on water on cupping, and the ability to identify where water is causing issues.* Ability to identify different intensities of sweet, salty and sour solutions (inspiration from [here](* Familiarity with the Le Nuz Du Cafe scents (or equivalent).* Comfortable in scoring a coffee using the SCAA Coffee Cupping Form (acknowledging the subjectivity in this, and fact you'd never get close to professional level)**Brewing** * Comprehensive understanding of making espresso, e.g. the impact of grind, ratio, distribution, temperature, pre-infusion, flow rate, pressure, dialing in, diagnosing poor technique.* Solid understanding of two other brew methods (for me, Aeropress and v60). Able to experiment with different techniques and identify differences which result.*Note: nothing in the above addresses green coffee grading - doesn't seem relevant enough for me as a home hobbyist.What would you add if you were making your own at-home course?

After a year and a half of drinking Nespresso, I decided I wanted to try the Bialetti Moka Express. I had a few questions about this.First, the directions mention using cold/room temperature water. But I've also read elsewhere that I should use hot water, because it cuts down on the brewing time, &amp; it prevents the coffee from tasting metallic. Is this true?Second, what do you recommend the heat setting/length of time? When will I know when to turn it off and when the coffee is ready?Third, should I use a cold towel/put the moka pot under cold running water to cool it after?Fourth, I read on another website the following:""Does The Moka Pot Make Espresso?I know that moka pots are often referred to as “stovetop espresso makers”, but sadly, that description is a little... optimistic.You see, espresso is made when hot water is forced through super fine coffee grounds at 8-10 bars of pressure. The moka pot is only capable of producing 1-2 bars.It’s just not enough to really be called true espresso, though the result is definitely espresso-like.The coffee is still intense, still heavy-bodied, and still good for making faux-espresso drinks like cappuccinos and americanos. But if you want to be able to make true espresso, you’ll need an actual espresso machine.""So my question is, with this in mind, should I not use the Lavazza espresso ground coffee, then?The directions were pretty bare-boned, so I'm trying to fill in some gaps here.

(I have a good amount of experience (6 months) with a La Marzocco Linea PB (Rather spoiled at work), which has four holes at the steam tip). However, let's pretend that the only upgrade I got was getting an *actual* espresso grinder e.g. getting a Rancilio Rocky (the Wilfa model at best only does moka pot fineness, and besides it's not even a stepless grinder). **Would such an upgrade ""suffice"" as far as getting richer espresso is concerned?** I suppose what I am really asking is ""how big"" an upgrade would *that* be value-wise compared to *also* getting a ""better"" espresso machine? This leads me to another question: **Assuming I know exactly what I am doing; and that I am using an espresso grinder; and that I am using all equipment to its fullest potential, then** ***what would I be able to accomplish*** **with a Silvia** ***which I could never accomplish*** **with a modded Dedica? Why?**TL;DR:""How much"" better could the espresso when using (Dedica + Rocky) vs. (Silvia + Rocky) and why? Considering upgrading from my modded Dedica Delonghi to a Rancilio Silvia E V6"

Just straight flavor, and spice, and fantastically smooth. My wife and I are hooked. I’ve looked up recipes (and the cafe was even nice enough to explain how they generally make theirs) and it seems that it can take quite a while to make these by hand. With 3 kids and work it can be hard to have time to do that prep in the mornings. However, we happen to be in the middle of a large kitchen remodel. We have space to put in an in-cabinet or countertop latte machine. Are there any good latte machines out there that would help in making these at home a little quicker? I came across Chime, but it seems that’s solely for Chai Tea Lattes and is pod-based. I would like to get something that isn’t pod-based (I hated having a Keurig), and that we can use to make a number of different drinks if we wanted to as well.

I’ve never been able to find one but admittedly I haven’t really seriously searched beyond my local roasters in Philadelphia. My question is regarding brew method. Once I get my hands on what should be a coffee with tons of fruit notes, is a Chemex ok? At home, I use a Chemex, white/bleached filters, 190°F water (filtered only from the filter in my fridge water dispenser), ~16:66 water:coffee ratio. I use a Krups burr grinder and set it on their recommendation for pour over (I think it’s between a 4-5 on the little dial. I’m not home now otherwise I’d confirm for sure!). I pour the first bit of water in (2x the bean weight) and let it sit for about a minute to bloom, then usually pour in the rest of the water in increments, about 100-150 g water at a time depending on how much in a rush I am.  I give the water a swirl so the grinds stay towards the bottom of the filter. Best brew method for a fruit bomb experience"

So diluted 50% would be 20 to 25 alkalinity and 70 to 80 hardness.  I tried two coffees and compared to same brew parameters they were more airy and clean than the same with 50% diluted TWW.  Their sweetness was more background and lighter.  The TWW brewed coffee had more direct sweetness.  I liked aspects of both.   From what I have read magnesium brings out sweetness where calcium brings out creamy texture.  I could see how the smooth, airness I got in the 50/50 magnesium calcium might have come from calcium.  Perhaps the lack of direct sweetness was from the higher alkalinity?  I noticed when I use TWW 100% it is often creamier, maybe from 40 to 50 alkalinity toning down acidity, but still more sweet from the higher magnesium.  How do others find alkalinity and hardness and whether hardness is calcium or magnesium affects taste? DIY water tips, what Kh source, calcium and magnesium proportions and levels do to taste etc."

I had a Rhino Hand Grinder from Rhinowear that I bought at the beginning of my journey into alternative brewing, but thought I wanted something better yet still small. Used a coupon I got as a gift and bought a Timemore Chestnut. Oh boy, they couldn't be more different. Yes, technically Timemore is 2x the price, but I think it's wort paying to anyone who can afford it at all. The advantages I notice:* It's so much faster. I can grind my dose in 20-30 seconds. It takes up to 2m with a Rhino. * The setting mechanism actually locks on to something. With Rhino I couldn't reliably fix it in a certain position when trying to get a coarse grind. I'm not sure if it's common for all cheaper grinders, but I suppose it comes down to the steel vs ceramic burrs as well, as steel ones produce a more uniform grind (and obviously they do it faster).Good hand grinders cost almost as much as a good entry-level electric grinder, but if you need to compromise on size or often get out with all your coffee gear, I think you should think twice about trying to save money on grinders. &amp;#x200B; Good Grinders vs Average Grinders"

I expected a massive jump in clarity and sweetness from the C2, because most reviews say it's a great upgrade from a ceramic burr grinder.To my surprise, I couldn't taste an obvious difference. I even had a hard time discerning one from another, and my guess was wrong when blind tasting.Then I remembered that I often see percolation methods (such as a V60) being used in grinder comparisons, but I don't fully get why. It seems odd to me because percolation (specially with a V60) is quite sensitive to the brewing technique, which is hardly exactly repeatable and adds another variable that impacts flavour. So, what's the best way to feel flavour differences from grinders and why? Which is the best brewing method to compare different grinders and why?"

I have been drinking like 100-300mg of caffeine a day typically. Not always, but most days especially m-f. I would always get tired later in the day (like a crash), so I drastically reduced the amount of sugar. Still felt the same. I figured I was just getting too used to caffeine or something so I cut it out for the past like week and a half. First few days sucked, but I have a pretty high willpower. I'm not craving it and I really do enjoy having not only coffee, but Im one of the few people that enjoy those jitters. I know I could drink decaf, but the main reason I even like coffee is for the caffeine. I've swapped to tea to see if it was the coffee, but it was kinda the same.Anyone else have this issue? Or is it just in my head (hopefully)? Coffee / Caffeine every day causes crash?"

I can then decide how to tweak recipes for the given coffee. I see how high extraction can go whilst still tasting good (but this is very grinder dependent). Much of what I say will apply to other brew methods as well.Firstly, here are the constants:* Hario Switch 03* Hario 03 filter papers with the tab.* Grinder is the Baratza Forte BG (steel 54mm ditting flat burrs)* Almost always 15g coffee to 250g water (but nevertheless the same ratio with other doses)* 100c water with hardness around 50ppm (Norway)* VST refractometer is zeroed with brew water before every measurement&amp;#x200B;Here are the results:* Grinding finer than you think you should will increase exraction to a point ( remember this is grinder dependent). Grinding too fine will not only make your drawdowns longer, but reduce extraction (this is common for both filter and espresso). I am grinding on the macro setting of 3 and up to the first half of 4 on the Forte. The coffee bed is muddy at the end. With multi-pour recipes with the brewer partially open (more on that below), you can grind coarser.* Water first and coffee last results in a faster drawdown by 30-60 seconds. * Coffee first and water last results in a slightly higher extraction (about 0.05 TDS) This is likely due to a slightly higher slurry temperature by adding the water last. The resulting brew is a few degrees C hotter too.* A larger brew recipe (for example 27g coffee to 450g water results in a higher exctraciton (also likely due to higher thermal mass) and vice versa. You won't need to adjust the grind by any significant amount here.* There is no point using water less than 100C. The Switch gives a final brew of about 5 degrees C cooler than other pourover brewers. The slurry during steep was around 83C.* Steep time for one-pour recipes is insignificant *after* 1 minute 30 seconds. Shorter than this and extraction is less. Over 3 minutes and extraction is so marginally higher it is not worth the wait (and the resulting brew is significantly cooler)* Stir like crazy at the start of a brew to ensure everything is mixed evenly (precision in this step is not required for extraction. Just make sure everything is evenly wet.)* Swirling and waiting 30 seconds before opening the brewer proved *very* significant in achieveing proper extraction. I preferred swirling at the end rather than stirring (although swirling is impossible if you brew the max 450g water). Without this step, TDS was only around 1.20.* James Hoffman's recipe of water first, add coffee, stir, wait 2 minutes, stir, wait 15-30 seconds, open brewer gave consistent results of TDS between 1.35-1.45. I prefer to wait 30 seconds before opening the brewer.* Want to brew with much higher extractions than 20-21% (1.35-1.45 TDS)? Sprometheus on youtube showed extractions well beyond this (22-24%). The key I have found is how often you pour onto a drained coffee bed. In his video, he pours 4 times and gets crazy high extraction.  However, I didn't like how long the brew took. I wanted to simplify this and did the following:   * Coffee first with brewer open. Pour 50g water and stir like crazy to evenly wet coffee. Wait 1 minute (we want a completely drained coffee bed). Close the brewer. Pour entire rest of water and swirl a litle. At between 1.30 and 2.00, swirl again and wait 30 seconds before opening hte brewer.      * Here I was getting TDS of 1.55-1.6. (22-23%) By changing my grind I can eventually adjust this to my liking.So how did the coffee actually taste? In short. Amazing. Clean. Evenly extracted. By following these rules, it will be hard to go wrong. This is such a consistent and easy to use brewer that I can recommend it to anyone out there regardless of experience in coffee. I got hold of a VST refractometer and did a deep analysis of Hario Switch recipes"

Sipping good tasting coffee at work, feels like it increased the quality of my life. It's truly amazing how we can find joy in such a small and seemingly insignificant things in our lives.Before, the coffee that I made with my Moka Pot the results were inconsistent. I always used fresh roasted beans from local roasters--sometimes I'd get a good cup of coffee, other times, not. Often I get a cup of coffee that's too acidic or too bitter.Asking around and doing some research (still learning), I learned that I needed to control the size of the grounds and the temperature at which I was boiling the water based on how old my beans were.And let me know if I'm wrong, I'm still learning and completely open for any advices.  But in short,   Smaller ground size --&gt; slower rate of flow of water through the grounds --&gt; more extraction  Bigger ground size --&gt;  faster rate of flow of water through the grounds --&gt; less extraction  Higher temp of stove --&gt; faster rate of flow  --&gt; less extraction  Lower temp of stove --&gt; slower rate of flow --&gt; more extraction  And the level of extraction determines how bitter or acidic or how perfect the cup of coffee isAnd so based on the freshness of the beans,  FRESH beans --&gt; more gas --&gt; slows the rate of flow --&gt; bigger ground size  older beans --&gt; less gas --&gt; faster rate of flow --&gt; smaller ground size  and based on my taste and the freshness of the beans, I can adjust any factors above (but I usually keep the stove temp constant and adjust the ground size), and I'm getting more constant results of my coffee. And the grinder that I'm using--Baratza Encore--isn't a super high end one, but for now, I'm satisfied with it as I'm still relatively new to the coffee world. Definitely my goal to get a good espresso machine and grinder, but that's down the road in the future. I think my Baratza and Moka Pot will serve me well for a good few years of time.I'm not sure why I decided to post this on reddit lol. It's just something that made me really happy recently and I guess I spontaneously wanted to share my joy :) I think I got my Moka Pot Down!"

Since moving to Japan in 2019, my options for oat milk were limited, untila couple of years ago Alpro became available and Minor Figures could be bought online. With MF costing double, I saved it for special occasions, especially as I mainly drink coffee without milk.This is also why I haven't invested in a steamer, and foam using a Hario wand. However, despite most oat milk being difficult to foam, I was always able to get the Alpro to foam.Recently, I was given a Nespresso milk foamer as a gift (I used to have something similar back in the UK, and it was very effective at foaming all milks) which prompted me to try making lattes again. However, the Alpro would not foam at all in the device, nor with my Hario wand. (I bought some more Alpro from a different just to be sure it wasn't a bad batch)I bought some Minor Figures barista, which foams really really well in the machine, but I found the barista version to have a much stronger oat flavour than the regular Minor Figures.This is where it gets strange though, I thought I would balance the Minor Figures by mixing in some Alpro, but the moment I add any Alpro to the minor figures (I'm talking, literally a splash, less than 5%) it stops the Minor Figures from foaming completely. It literally does not foam at all.This has me thinking there must be something in the Alpro to stop it from foaming. Alpro has recently introduced a Barista version of their oat milk in Japan, so I'm wondering if they are adding something to the regular oat milk to stop it foaming in order to make their Barista version more compelling to people wanting to use it for coffee, as I see no other explanation why a tiny amount would completely stop minor figures from foaming (plus the fact Alpro used to foam)That is, unless there is some other explanation that goes beyond my (admittedly limited) knowledge.

I'm left attempting to try them from Starbucks? Google/wikipedia inform me that traditionally that it consists of 2 ristretto shots over about 4 oz of water.    I've attempted this maneuver a few times at Starbucks. I have found more success requesting this in person especially because a long black is traditionally suppose to consist of the espresso being brewed over the water. Requesting in person seems to be an essential requirement in SPITE of a recent wonderful barista informing me that it should work if I select 'upside down' while ordering this concoction. I attempted this order ahead of time recently and it tasted the most bitter yet.    I do not own an espresso machine. I do not know how to brew/craft/create a perfect shot of espresso. Just been enjoying tasting a good espresso? I tried to have an indy coffee shop whip me up a Long Black once but I don't remember how it tasted very well.   Can I add a splash of almond milk to this concoction? I know this is a kinda redundant question but I haven't tried yet. I  have enjoyed a good Long Black thus far and have worried added almond/coconut/creamer would throw off the taste. I know I could request to make sure they add the tiniest splash and/or ask them to steam the milk?   Intro espresso machine? Recommendations?

We should all have it and we should all know how to use it. After all, it's an essential part of our daily lives and hobbies, so why shouldn't it be a part of this hobby?I've left a few comments on some threads about using a journal with their exploration of coffee, and since there was positive feedback and a pattern that showed not many people did this, I thought I'd bring up why I do it, how I do it, and how you can do it too.And the best part about this enhancement to your brewing journey? It's CHEAP and one of the best upgrades you can make to your brewing kit that enhances consistency, thoughtfulness, and enjoyment. You'll really see a difference with this, give it a try and see how it impacts your ritual. What do you have to lose?# What? Journal?Mindfulness is next to godliness and thoughtfulness is next to happiness. We drink coffee to enjoy it and be happy. So we should think about it too. Simple, easy, perfect. Or at least it would be if we could remember how to replicate that perfect cup *every time*. However we forget, we mess up, and sometimes we want to try something different and experiment to try something new.Notice that word in that last sentence? Experiment? Well, that's something funny about coffee. It's drinkable chemistry! If you're going to think back to your chemistry class, what did you always have with you in the lab? A lab journal. It was useful in making sure you could repeat your results and confirm that. Well, this Coffee Journal is exactly the same. We're going to record our experiments with our coffee and make it so we can repeat them as much as we want to.# Why though?We already think about our coffee a lot. We think about grind size, fine distribution, method of brew, and eventually taste. But what if we want to taste that cup again? Well with our ~~lab~~ coffee journal we can remember exactly how we made that cup, and we can remember how that cup tasted. It lets us dial, trial, and reproduce our experimental brews and enjoy a great cup of coffee again and again. We can even do some tasting notes or custom scoring.# Cost to benefit ratioAstronomical. If a grinder with 150 dollars has tons of steps and you try chasing a certain cup, how do you remember where you started? Easy, you wrote it down every step of the way and can go back to the one you liked or change it in an easy step forward.It also lets you experiment with developing your palette in really fun and exciting ways after you're used to the coffee with pairings! Add some spices? write down your thoughts. Have it with ice cream? [Write that down]( # An ExampleEarlier I posted a picture of one I did real fast while having an evening cup of decaf with my desert. Because I have handwriting, it might be hard to read for some people, and so for them, I have transcribed it below. This was just one tasting I recorded in a new journal but the basics are all here. How I brewed it, how much I brewed, what method I used, and what I thought.I didn't score it, but that's because I didn't want to. Next time if I want to score it? Just do it!Date: 4-12-2022  Roaster: Chocolatefish (local to Sacramento, CA)  Bean: La Union Decaf  Roasted: 4-5-2022Grinder: Javapresse hand grinder  Setting: 7Brew Method: Pour Over Pitcher* Modified Hoffman ultimate v60: Bloom, Half, Rest* 30 grams coffee to 500ml water at 205 degrees FareinheightPairings:* Tillamook Oregon Strawberry  enhances:   * Chocolate Nib   * Roast   * Fruit(no acid, non citris, pulp)* Godiva Mini Peanut and Honey bar  enhances:   * Cocoa fat   * Caramel (salted)   * Fruit Acid(non-pulp, stone?)Taste: Good, chocolate, fruit acid, caramel finishAccurate to Roaster Tasting Notes :)Now tomorrow I know what that coffee tastes like with that recipe and I can do it againOr I could change it. Want some more acid to come out? Less heat or finer grinds(or both). Want some more roast to come out? Rougher grinds or hotter water. Want some different notes thrown in? Mix some other coffees in small ratios to modify the taste or add some spices. With this journal, I know how each of those cups tastes, and I can use it to taste it again or make it for some friends.Maybe I should try some peanut butter in a dark roast cup. I wonder how that would taste? Well after I do that, I can certainly tell anyone else what happened thanks to this journal, and I can even use it to swap recipes! Probably get a sifter set though and communicate grind size in microns if you really want to do that.Now it's your turn to take on this journey. Don't just do this for coffee though. Get a journal for each of your hobbies and have fun learning, experimenting, and enjoying everything you can think of and being able to do it again and again.Now go drink and be jittery.# NotesThe Hoffman Technique for v60 can be found on youtube, I'm sure a lot of you have seen it. [Here is a link]( in case you haven't.Modified Hoffman Technique: I modified the ratios of water that you use. Bloom uses about 2x the grind weight in ml, so if you use 30g, you'll use 60ml and at that point, you've gotten more than 10% of 500ml, so followed by 50% of the grind you get a bit over the 60% he suggests you have poured by the time point. This just makes the math a bit easier since it's Bloom(B), Half(H), then whatever is left, and thus the Rest(R) of the grinds, hence why it is BHR.Pairings are something you do with cheese, wine, booze, anything you can test, etc. so you can enhance or expose parts of the pallet and you can absolutely do that with coffee with whatever you want. Do a base cup, then pair a few things. You'd be surprised how quickly this really expands your pallet and language.My water is straight almost perfect, so I just use Sacramento city water filtered with Brita and mixed back to the city water in a 2:1 ratio to bring down the chlorination a bit and get a pretty great extraction with a great range of TDS and PH.

I assume I can just strain it again with cheesecloth but it would take another 4 layers so catch anything and if it didn’t get it all the first time, I doubt it would the second. What am I doing wrong? Do I need to use another system to strain? Could it be the brand of grounds? Cold brew problems"

The two brands each had different US based distribution companies, but last year Smartco decided to go with new distributors for both brands. Legally the previous distribution companies owned any warranty claims, but since Smartco has always been the puppet master behind the scenes it feels slimy that they are refusing to continue to take care of machines that they themselves made. It also seems stupid from a business perspective to sully the image of a brand that they have always owned. ([ [ \- screenshot of this page below)So while Smartco may not be doing anything illegal, if you buy any Bonavita or Brewista products you just have to hold your breath and hope they don't decide to change to a new distributor again and leave all their existing customers hanging.

I'm not sure if this post belongs here, but I had an immediate urge to write about this. Perhaps it's a cautionary tale. Some time ago I wanted to order Option-O Lagom Mini, but it was out of stock for many months. Then, some time ago suddenly it was back in, so I made the order. I especially ordered the Obsydian Burrs (48mm) to make espresso.I just got my Option-O Lagom Mini package and was about to try it out, but I noticed something strange with the package - it was cut at the bottom. I had a bad feeling about this and opened the inside box. I noticed that the main body of the grinder was taken out of the white plastic packaging, while the cup and the power charger were still in their bags as they should be after leaving the factory. I also noticed that the white cover for the coffee input was broken. It seems like someone hastily opened the package somewhere on the way and did something with the main body, breaking the input cover along the way. Then I looked inside the main body and I noticed what happened. Someone switched the Obsydian Burrs (48mm) to the regular ones. I looked at the photos of both types of burrs which are on Option-O's homepage and I am now 100% sure that the burrs were replaced during transport. The DHL package it came in looked fine, and no one from the Post office in  Japan (where I live) would ever do such a thing, so it must have been done right before sending it by post. Either by a factory worker or someone who took the package to the post office to send it. I'm attaching photos to show you how it looks. Obviously, the first thing I did was to contact Option-O, and am now waiting for their answer. Please, everyone, check your packages. Especially products with optional settings, like the optional 48mm burrs for Option-O in my case, which are easy to swap could be objects of theft. If I get an answer from Option-O I will post an update.&amp;#x200B;[The main body of the grinder was not in the white plastic packaging.]([The burrs somebody replaced for the cheaper ones.]([Broken plastic input cover.]( Option-O Lagom Mini package meddling and burr theft"

I had just gotten out of a long-term relationship, family problems, financial stress as well as instability in my home country yada yada… There was probably a period of around 10 months when I would be in bed 20+ hours a day, only leaving home once per week to shop. Weeks passed me by in an instant and I would have no recollection on what I did during the time. I constantly felt like I was too far gone to even bother with, and that I was a burden on everyone around me. I'm sure people with depression can relate.&amp;#x200B;One day, an old friend reached out to me and invited me over to his place to watch the new season of Always Sunny, which used to be our favorite show when we were flatmates back in school. I normally ghost everybody due to social anxiety and general lethargy but for some reason on that day, (thank god) I decided to go. Long story short, he made some pourover for me (which I had not tried until that point) that changed my perspective entirely on coffee. The flavors were intense and complex, and I was amazed at how it tasted almost like juice at the end as it cooled. &amp;#x200B;When I got home that night, with some help from said friend, I ordered a V60 dripper, some filter papers, a coffee scale, a decanter, a gooseneck kettle and a Hario hand grinder. My first few cups were not great, but as I learned more and more about how different factors such as ground size and temperature influence extraction (thanks to youtube channels like James Hoffmann obviously), my mornings became something to look forward to. &amp;#x200B;As I troubleshot every problem with my brew and came up with solutions, my confidence grew and I became more and more aware that I was capable of feeling passion about something still; I still wanted to improve at something. I realized that it had been so long since I even cared about anything outside of doing the bare minimum. This realization hit me like a ton of bricks. Not long after, I decided to finally call my parents and tell them everything about my depression, and I started seeing a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) and have been seeing the same doctor regularly since. &amp;#x200B;Fast forward to now, I still have rough days. However, I have cut down on smoking in order to taste better (still enjoy coffee with a cigarette though, just not smoking a pack a day anymore). I have also just upgraded to a Comandante C40 as an early birthday present to myself, and the difference it made in my brews was unbelievable and has made me even more excited about making coffee. I want to go thank my friend for introducing me to making coffee but I'm not sure if I want to tell him about my depression, might make him uncomfortable as we tend to stick to lighter topics.&amp;#x200B;Anyways, thanks for reading. While I'm still a long way from complete recovery, I'm not sure how long I would have wallowed in that hole without even trying to seek help without this hobby. Coffee and how it got me to seek help"

Yesterday I brewed a v60 with 15g of coffee with a 250g brew weight, so a pretty normal cup, but later that afternoon I would find out it wasn’t a normal cup. An hour after drinking the coffee I felt the effects of  the caffeine. It felt like a super strong coffee. Throughout the day it felt like I had butterflies in my stomach and I was jittery all day. Normally I make a mid afternoon coffee but even after a few hours it felt like I just consumed a cup just a half an hour ago.This morning I brew the same cup for myself and again I am feeling the super strong effects of this coffee. 30 minutes later and it feels like I had 3 cups instead of one.Has this happened to anyone else and could anything I could have done effect how I absorb the caffeine. Almost makes me not want to drink it if I’m going to feel anxious all day, but I probably still will because it’s just to good. Coffee with unusually high amount of caffeine"

I had feigned interest in other methods over the years but never stuck with it, probably because I had been doing it completely wrong. I wish I had figured this out years ago.Last week I ordered a French press, an electric kettle, some fresh beans, and wow. My life has been changed. Today, I finally brewed using the 1:15 ratio as my kitchen scale came in the mail yesterday.  I found I had been eye-balling the beans by almost half as much as I should have been using. My life changed again.Just like any special interest, one can take it as far as they want to go. This has instilled a new found appreciation of coffee in me, and I can't wait to try a bunch of different beans/roasts. Eyeing some local roasteries near me to support small businesses and get the freshest I can get.Even still, I need to get a proper grinder. Currently using the flat bladed bean grinder attachment/cup that is on my bullet blender. Can get it fairly consistently coarse, but with more beans this becomes more difficult. &amp;#x200B;How many of your coffee-drinking friends/family have you converted to proper brewing? Do they care?  It's like an entirely new drink! Simply unbelievable. Happy to bean here. :) I just started drinking coffee today."

I have been dealing with reflux since last September, and my normal coffee has been affecting it since last November. I have tried several things (will detail below), but so far the only type of coffee that has definitely not caused any symptoms is the premade starbucks iced coffee that you buy in the refrigerator section of the grocery store near the milk. Here is a detailed list of what has bothered me and how much so it has. Note that I have historically been a simple coffee drinker, and what I have brewed at home was with an $8 walmart drip brewer with grounds bought at the grocery store.   **Bothers me the most (symptoms last for up to over 24 hours):**  Caribou Coffee Medium Roast ([Link](  Caribou Coffee Mahogany Dark Roast ([link](Caribou Coffee Decaf Medium Roast ([Link](&amp;#x200B;**Bothers me a decent amount (symptoms for a few hours):**  Starbucks decaf bought in the cafe  **Bothers me slightly sometimes:**  Grocery store sold starbucks cold brew ([Link](  **Does not bother me at all:**  Grocery store sold starbucks iced dark roast ([Link](    **The symptoms caused by coffee:**  Bloating  Belching (including slight regurgitation in the worst cases near the start of it)  Tasting acid  Generally feeling bad  If it helps, the main cause of my reflux seems to be Reflux Hypersensitivity, as PPI's did not remove my symptoms, but treating for reflux hypersensitivity seems to be slowly improving my symptoms.    So at this point I am trying to figure out what about the above coffees that cause me issues is causing it, and to see if there are more types of coffee that I can drink without any issue besides the starbucks iced coffee. I don't know if its a specific type of bean or if it has something to do with the brewing processes. I don't believe it is caffeine itself (though I know it does affect some peoples reflux) since I can have the iced coffee without issue.  Any advice anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated. I miss having hot coffee in the mornings. The Iced gets the job done, but I want than just that. I am willing to put some money into a good coffee maker, and even a good grinder if needed, if it allows me to have a good cup of coffee in the morning that doesn't upset my reflux.  Thank you for any help you can give! I will try to answer any questions in the comments if any extra details will help figure something out. Trying to figure out what coffee does and does not set off my Reflux"

My problem is that I don't understand a thing about coffee except being able to enjoy it.I've used home machines that have a basket which you tamper, but I'm now focusing on the Nespresso Vertuo series, as it's been the easiest method to get good tasting and consistent coffee without having to worry so much about weighing etc. For my situation, it has been perfect (I am no coffee, purist - so not trying to start a debate, just looking for advice).Typically when I am out, I like to order a Flat White (Australian Coffee Term for basically a cappuccino - minus the froth and chocolate powder). I'd like to replicate this at home so a very consistent level, but I don't know what coffee to milk ratio is required.  I've found that commercial grade machines, extract less water to coffee compared to the home appliance counterparts, which I find require more extraction to compensate for flavour. I don't know if this is true, I really don't understand the theory, I just drink the damn thing.So, could anyone provide me with some tips, coffee /milk ratio to getting an even more enjoyable experience at home?

The good thing was that it was convenient, and it was always nice taking a walk to grab a coffee. The downsides were that I didn’t get the chance to appreciate the other aspects of coffee, such as the difference in beans and the preparation process.That all changed when the pandemic forced everything to close down, and I had to shift to working from home. Since I could no longer get my fix from coffee shops, I had to drink the instant coffee I had at home. I could only take so much of the instant; this led me down the rabbit hole. To start, I picked up an Aeropress and some beans from local roasters near me after I browsed this sub and watched some YouTube videos. That eventually led to me picking up a Kalita Wave and trying out beans from roasters all over Canada. I subjectively rated each bean based on how much I enjoyed drinking it. I tasted the beans using the Kalita and Aeropress while dialling in different grind settings and brew temps and times. All of my thoughts are based on drinking these coffees black. No cream or sugar/sweeteners are added. Now to the point of the post. Even after trying all the different beans, I think I know which type of taste profile I enjoy, but it’s still tough to determine based on the information that roasters share on their sites. I’m hoping that if I list some of those details about the beans, such as origin, tasting notes, and a quick blurb of my thoughts on what I enjoyed, you all could help me identify some things I should keep an eye out for when I order new beans. I also get that I might be well off just sticking to ordering beans that list similar notes to the ones that I know I enjoy or keep ordering from the roasters I liked the most, but that’s no fun. Also, I’ve excluded the names of the roasters from this list to avoid potentially breaking any rules related to promotion on the sub. Here goes: &amp;#x200B;|Location|Score out of 10|Tasting Notes|Thoughts||:-|:-|:-|:-||Honduras - El Portillo |8|Toffee, Walnuts|This was my first taste of specialty roasted coffee. Very enjoyable everyday roast. ||Guatemala - Providencia|7.5|Peanut Butter, Hazelnut, Raisins|It had an interesting hint of sweetness I'd never noticed in coffee before. ||Peru - Huadquina|9|Chocolate, Honey, Mango|Thought I was drinking chocolate with every sip. ||Blend (origin unknown)|8.5|Toffee, Fig|Tastes exactly like what I would expect out of a medium roast if I were to order at a cafe. ||Blend - Brazil/Colombia (half-caf)|7|Cherry, Caramel, Dark Chocolate|This one had a strong aroma, but lacked a certain punch of flavour. ||Kenya |9|Grape, White Nectarine|I enjoyed the notes of fruitiness in this coffee. Seemed like a lighter roast. ||Ethiopia - Bensa|7|Blueberry, Strawberry Yogurt, White Peach |Fruity, but in a funky way as opposed to a sweet way. ||Colombia - Popayan|8|Dark Chocolate, Papaya, Cacao|This one had a pronounced, almost bold, flavour to it. Not quite bitter, but what a coffee noob (like myself) would call 'dark'. ||Brazil |8|Vanilla, Milk Chocolate, Cherry, Creamy|I did notice the light hints of chocolatey-ness. I could drink this every day too. ||Costa Rica|8|Cinnamon, Fruit Cake, Rose|Similar type of funk to the beans from Bensa, Ethiopia. This was a bit more enjoyable, though. ||Blend - Ethiopia/Brazil |8.5|Apricot, Cherry, Strawberry Cream|A mellow version of the funky Ethiopian beans. ||Blend - Brazil/Colombia|8|Dark Chocolate, Hazelnut|This is what I would expect a dark roast from a cafe would taste like. ||Colombia|9.5|Plum, Berries, Black Tea|This was my favourite one. I'd say the tasting note of berries is very accurate. ||Brazil |9|Toffee, Creamy, Milk Chocolate|I feel like this one would be better described as Dark Chocolate instead of Milk. I loved the boldness. It was almost toasty. ||Guatemala - Santa Cruz Barillas|9|Sugar Cookie, Butter Caramel, Almond|I didn't quite get the hints of cookies, but it was quite nutty. ||Honduras|8.5|Walnuts, Dark Chocolate, Marzipan|Another mellow coffee. Only the slightest hints of chocolate. It was tough to notice right away. ||Kenya - Kaliluni|8|Red Currant, Cherry, Cacao|I was hoping that this was going to taste like the sweet type of fruit from the previous Kenyan bean, but it was less pronounced. |&amp;#x200B;I'm not the best when it comes to describing coffee notes, so I apologize in advance if my blurbs aren't very helpful. The original goal I had in mind when I was tracking these beans and flavours was to help me figure out the general profile for my favourite types of coffee beans. I figured I'd make a post out of it since I've come across tons of helpful info in this sub throughout the last couple of years. Pandemic coffee experience"

Problem is that some of them have a recommendation of using amounts of water that are more than the gaiwan can hold. To get the best results, should I scale down water + tea amount proportionally, or is it better to use the recommended water + tea amounts with a bigger cup and don't use the gaiwan?2) I have some mate (not a tea, but still). I don't have a filtered straw, or the special glass for it. The packaging recommends brewing it western style, for like 5 minutes, but reading online thats not at all how its usually drank. Worth buying a kit for it or is it pretty close already? I really like it so far. 3) What do I do if I'm drinking a loose leaf tea that can do 12 or even more infusions, but I don't have time to drink them all, or can't share it with others? Can I just put it away, and use it the next day? Feels like being wet could cause it to become worse maybe. Store in fridge/just leave it outside/let it dry, but cover it/...?Maybe I'm just overthinking it haha. Thanks for any help 🍵 A couple questions I didn't find answers to in the wiki"

This continues from that, exploring if there is an inexpensive way to have related experience, that doesn't involve spending $80 to 100 on higher quality, natural arbor sourced sheng versions (or $50 for something presented as of more modest quality, or at least better value).  These are ""factory teas,"" less expensive and different versions / style, with tuocha a reference to the shape, compressed into a ball, or bird's nest shape really.  They don't cost much; I just saw a newer Dayi / Taetea version listed for $6 (for 100 grams), and finding somewhat aged versions for around $10-15 isn't so unusual.  Not truly aged though, which are in higher demand.  This style of tea transitions to a warmer, milder, more complex flavor and character range after about 15 years, and bitterness and astringency switch over to other flavor and feel.  This describes what it's like trying them halfway through that transition process, at 7 and 10 years old.[&amp;#x200B; trying 2010 and 15 Xiaguan and Dayi / Taetea tuochas"

I'm buying from a second hand store that sells it at the same price but has less variations. Tea sachets always confused me and I'm not sure if I'm making them wrong, I'd pick their loose leaf anytime because it's much easier to measure. I don't wanna waste a perfectly good cuppa just because I made it the wrong way. So based on you guy's experience, how much water do I use in those weird sachets, is it for one 200ml cup or a 400ml?

Why should tea be named according to the same standards as over-marketed weed strains and crappy micro-brewed beers? It turns me off, should I just get over it? Maybe part of it is that I don't want to be expecting a certain taste based on a marketing gimmick and then get something completely different.

However Harney has a sale right now on a lot of their more expensive Chinese black teas, and I figured that now is a good time to try some of those, and they make even ""Hao Ya A"" look cheap in comparison.Harney tins only have the outer lid with no inner lid. I would prefer not to buy more double sealed canisters for things that already come in cans, or put them in bags when they already come in tins and attractive ones at that. I am wondering if there might be a good way to seal the tins without changing them, like an aftermarket solution where I can buy maybe rubber squares of the right size or something I can cut to the right size or something like that? Does anyone have any suggestions here? Double sealing Harney tins?"

Two things I see posted again and again are “where can I buy real Yixing?” And “Is this pot I got second hand real Yixing”. This post is an attempt to answer both of those as well clarify a lot of misconception about the craft in general. I spend most of my day authenticating and translating teapot seals and every summer I visit (not recently obviously) Dingshu town in Yixing China where the local artisans live and sell prefired pots. I feel I’m pretty knowledgeable. First some clarification. Yixing teapot refers extremely specifically to teapots constructed in a slab built (not thrown on a pottery wheel) method and of ore mined in and around the town of Yixing. This started with HuangLongShan mine and has expanded to others, then the government ceased mining operations at most sights. Pots are either fully hand made or half handmade. The names associated with this clay are ZiSha or ZiNi aka purple sand. There are many sub categories and specific types of clay such as DaHongNi but this is unimportant. Teapots made of other clay are not Yixing. Teapots that are injection mold slip casted are not Yixing. These pots will often have the name Yixing China stamped on the bottom though. This brings me to Yixing rule number one: If you bought a pot for less than 100USD. It’s not real sorry. This is the entry for half handmade pots. Fully handmade shoots that price up. Artist renown shoots it up more. You will not get Yixing for less than 100USD. Period. And those fancy sets with all the cups and poem on the box, those are the worst. Rule number two: if it doesn’t have a seal stamped on the bottom it’s not Yixing. The government controls pottery and works of registered artists are required to be stamped and their stamps are catalogued. If it just has a name carved into it or nothing it’s probably made in Taiwan or a fake cashgrab. Rule number three: if the pot is super ornate with carvings or nature scenes molded into it and you didn’t pay a hefty sum, it’s slip casted injection molded clay and fake.So where can I get real Yixing? —Are you interested in function and want the best clay for enhancing tea without regard to it being “art” or one of a kind?You want a vintage government backed factory pot. Ideally out of factory one during the 70s and 80s. Half handmade and have some liberties taken with craftsmanship but made of the best clay that is now no longer available.  is the best for this. There are some others like “authenticYixing” but I personally trust this seller. —Do you not care so much about vintage or one of a kind and would like a modern pot centered in functionality made of authentic (but not factory one) clay?Mud and leaves is the place to go they work with Chen Chunhong and his wife to ship in their half handmade pots. Good price, interviews with the craftsman, great craftsmanship.— Do you want a work of art?For modern but adhering to traditional standards and fully hand made on of a kind  is the place. They video call with the nationally recognized and ranked craftsmen and have everything from rising apprentice works to master level potters. For modern and not adhering to traditional standards and form Yinchen studio is great. They offer some half and some fully handmade but they break a lot of rules in regard to teapot form and are like the modern art side of Yixing. Vintage fully handmade… sorry these are ridiculously expensive or on display in the national museum of Chinese art.Now there are certainly other places to buy. I would strongly avoided these unless you are into the hobby and have done a good bit of research into authentication. The problem is that every other shop (Yunnan sourcing and the likes) don’t post the artist, clay type, or production method of their available pots. All the places mentioned above do, most having video interviews or videos of pots being made as well. Any further questions ask away! A guide to Yixing teapots and where to buy"

gone year wth drinking herbal almost never herbal usually green black also gone year iron deficiency period way ever normal level supplementing mega dos iron mg consistently night time vit c however always go soon forget supplement day iron supplementing instead getting iron food quite expensive probably optimal health finally making decision quit night time eat wondering tannin low tannin absolutely tannin tannin,1,787,150,"So I have gone 6 years wth only drinking tea (95% herbal). I almost never drink water, just herbal tea and usually a cup of green and/ or black tea. I have also gone about 8 years with iron deficiency. During this period the only way I have ever had a normal level is when I am supplementing mega doses of iron (300mg) consistently at night time with vit. C. This however always goes down again as soon as I forget to supplement for a few days. This iron supplementing instead of getting iron from food is quite expensive and probably not optimal for my health. I am now finally making the decision to quit tea (only having tea at night time after I eat). I am wondering if there are any teas with no tannins? like not low in tannins, but absolutely no tannins? Do all teas have tannins?"

Over the past year, this general enjoyment has also turned into a hobby - trying new varieties, enjoying traditional style handmade teaware, reading this sub, etc. However, I'm finding I drink quite a bit of caffeine, and for health reasons (trying to get pregnant) I would like to cut down. I'm wondering if anybody has any advice on cutting down on caffeine while still getting to enjoy tea? So far, switching to a smaller pot (a 125mL hohin, vs. my 250mL kyusu) makes me feel like I can drink enough cups of tea to be satisfied, but because the portions are smaller, it ends up being less tea overall. I would be interested in getting an even smaller pot and cup so I can continue with that same method.   I'm also looking into lower caffeine teas to substitute for my full-caffeine favourites (gyokuro, sencha asamushi, korean semi-wild). Unfortunately the one kukicha I found I wasn't too keen on (could have been a lower quality?) and I prefer vegetal greens rather than the toasty notes of a houijicha.   If anybody has any suggestions on small volume Japanese tea pots, or lower caffeine green teas, I'd be very grateful! Also appreciative of any general advice that has helped others. Any tips on cutting down caffeine while still enjoying tea?"

high end first flush indian also fresh stuff teavivre keeping original resealable pouch cabinet enough put ziploc well double sealed go step window open hot humid rainy day would impact sometimes cigarette stink seeps apartment neighbor well also paranoid issue yet summer fact take several month month depending one keep nice long sensitive odor humidity really storing enough,1,778,155,"I like high end first flush Indian teas and also have some fresh stuff from Teavivre. Is keeping the tea in its original resealable pouch in a cabinet good enough? For most of the them, I put them in a ziploc as well, so they are double sealed and I try to go a step further. If my window is open on a hot, humid  or rainy day, would it impact the tea? Sometimes cigarette stink seeps into my apartment from my neighbor as well🤢 which also makes me paranoid. I haven’t had any issues yet, but with the summer being here and the fact that it will take me several months to drink some of the teas (2-6 months+ depending on which ones I like the most)…I want to try to keep them nice as long as I can! How sensitive is tea to odors and humidity really? Am I storing it good enough?"

I'm using about 3 times as much tea as the retailer recommends, steeping for the max recommended time, and heating water to the recommended temperature. The teas are all... nice, I guess, but they mostly taste to me like hot water with a little bit of other flavors - and very few of those flavors are what I think of as that quintessential black tea flavor.The retailer recommends one teaspoon ""per cup"" (which I understand typically means 6 ounces in the tea world). I have a 20 ounce teapot, so I'm using 2 tablespoons, AKA 6 teaspoons. That amount expands to fill the infuser basket most or all of the way.I've also tried adding a very small amount of sugar, but that does nothing to bring out any flavor (just makes it slightly sweet).***Am I just not cut out for tea?

Yesterday I brew my tea with mineral water for the first time and oh boy, does it make a difference...I've always been brewing my tea in tap water boiled (or brought up to other temp) in your standard kettle, as tap water in my country is drinkable even raw (straight from tap). The taste of tea was always.. ok-ish. Could sense different notes of flavour, no chlorine taste or smell was present, overall nice experience.Though when I drank tea in my local teashop the difference was always there. Talking about same tea cultivars from same year tasted there and in home, as they also sell the tea leaves they serve to guests. Teashop tea was always more reach and balanced. Always. I thought that they have some great know-how, since they are business. Well... turns out it probably was just water all along.I used bottled mineral water, all other factors seemed the same to me. Tea got far more flavour, especially in those subtle notes which suddenly exploded from the infusion taste, it was overall more reach and balanced, like in tea shop.So my dear fellow tea drinkers - make sure you have good water for your adventures with tea. Cheers! Water quality"

I'm curious if anyone's got suggestions for places to buy really nice loose mugicha. Obviously it doesn't have the culture around it that actual tea has, and so the ceiling for quality is probably very much lower, but I'm interested in getting as close to that as I can easily get. I've looked at some of the stuff offered by places on the subreddit vendor list, but since that list is (naturally) aimed more at actual tea, I'm curious if anyone has any specific suggestions.(I'm in the US, so places that can ship here would be preferred.)

Peach Cobbler was too subtly flavoured/not very peachy, Cherry Bakewell was a bit tangy cherry, not much else, Dark Choc Chilli Chai was okay but didn't blow me away, Totally Nutty was quite good, but Bonfire Toffee (which I think is a great tea) just didn't somehow suit my tastebuds.This time I got the following four teas:* **Creme Egg Tea** - *Sri Lankan black tea, cocoa nibs, cocoa shells, jasmine blossom, sunflower petals, natural flavouring* - a really incredible tea that tastes like chocolate custard but is not remotely ""sickly"" or artificial, as many chocolate-flavoured teas can be. The jasmine is very subtle, I couldn't markedly detect it, but I feel it gives a slight floral hint/lift. As an experiment I brewed a cup adding a tiny bit of jasmine tea, and the extra jasmine actually didn't work, so I think they've got the balance perfect.* **Birthday Cake** - *Rooibos (84%), Sri Lankan Black Tea, Sprinkles, Almond Pieces, Vanilla Pieces, Mallow Flowers, natural flavouring* - I'm not a huge fan of rooibos generally, but the almond in this really brings it together and it's an exceptionally smooth cup and much like Yorkshire Biscuit Tea, is somehow ""savoury"" rather than sweet.* **The Big Smoke** - *Chinese pu'er tea, ginger, lemongrass, lapsang souchong black tea, red peppercorns* - honestly one of the most fascinating and drinkable flavoured teas I've had. It's like a savoury smoky lemon chai. I will almost certainly be ordering this one again, as well as looking for similar blends.* **Coconut Milk Oolong** - *Taiwanese milk oolong, coconut flakes, desiccated coconut* - this one is supposed to be brewed at 80c and the first time I made it I brewed it too hot, not letting the boiled water cool enough. This made it taste like bitter green tea not even an oolong. The second time I put some cold water in the cup first and the transformation was amazing. It's so smooth. I even managed to drink a cup of it without milk and didn't hugely struggle as I usually do with black/non-milk-added tea. The only thing I wonder about is whether the coconut could be a bit stronger? So I'm going to try adding some extra coconut to a future cup to see what that does.

The episode talked about Yogi Bhajan (Harbhajan Singh Khalsa) who came from India in the 60s and set up a big cult called [3HO]( Yogi Tea is one of the corporate entities of 3HO.Yogi Bhajan encouraged his followers to move in together and form Ashrams. They were encouraged to buy houses and put them in the cult’s name. They were encouraged to work for the cult and to send their children to boarding schools 3HO set up in India. Some of the women have come out and said that they were sexually abused by Yogi Bhajan (he died in 2004, and his family now owns Yogi Tea and continues the cult). The children at the boarding schools were beaten regularly and went through a lot at the schools. While the Yogi’s family got rich, a lot of the supporters were very poor, living in squalor, and working for the cult.I just thought Yogi tea was just one of the multiple regular tea companies on the market. I had no idea it had such a dark origin story.I thought others would like to know and watch the episode for themselves. I have no problem with Yogis and SE Asian religions, but I do have a problem with organizations who take advantage of women and children. I thought others would like to know where their money is going. The people who head 3HO now deny any wrongdoing by Yogi Bhajan (even though he had multiple young wives brought up in the cult). There’s so many other brands out there, and it’s cool that there’s so many small independent companies we can patronize. Yogi Tea makes billions a year. Disturbing info about Yogi Tea being owned by a cult"

On the same occasion, I wanted to learn how to improve my preparation skills to get a better result on my beverage of choice, so in that regard I have several questions: \- What do I need to make good tea? I'm using tea leaves (not bags) in a cup that is made to prepare to infuse the tea, but it prevents me from making more of it or even transferring it to another recipient. So I assume that I need a kettle and something to boil the water (maybe a 2 in one?). What do you recommend in that regard? I would like something durable (lifetime would be the best) and efficient, I don't mind paying a bit extra if it's not an incoherent amount.\- Next, the leaves. The quality is a factor but how do I recognize the good stuff from the bad one? I'm already going to a specialized shop that got a tea that smells and tastes fantastic if I compare it with basics teabags. But I don't know if it's just an ok tea or if I'm wasting my money on expensive tea that isn't worth its cost. Here's a picture of what I bought for my earl grey: [\- Finally, the technique. Right now I'm not doing anything particular, I boil water, pour it into my cup (in my particular case, it's already in) then add the tea leaves and let it infuse by itself for 5 minutes. Is there anything I should do or pay attention to? Oh, and if you have any advice for someone that drinks mostly earl grey and earl grey variations to try something new, I'm all ears.Thx in advance to anyone that takes the time to read and/or answer me.

Every morning I drink very strong black teas with a bit of oat milk, but when the weather starts to get warmer I usually switch to cold brew coffee (also with a splash of oat milk).

Is Assam a good idea for this purpose? And is it better to cold brew it (I have never done that with tea) or steep as usual and just add ice afterwards or something?

Usually from Starbucks or other coffee shops. Until I had a REAL chai tea latte from a local Indian coffee/deli shop last week. Holy cow the difference. It was AMAZING. Not a sugar overload. Just straight flavor, and spice, and fantastically smooth. My wife and I are hooked. I’ve looked up recipes (and the cafe was even nice enough to explain how they generally make theirs) and it seems that it can take quite a while to make these by hand. With 3 kids and work it can be hard to have time to do that prep in the mornings. However, we happen to be in the middle of a large kitchen remodel. We have space to put in an in-cabinet or countertop latte machine. Are there any good latte machines out there that would help in making these at home a little quicker? I came across Chime, but it seems that’s solely for Chai Tea Lattes and is pod-based.

I have no idea what they used; all we’ve been told is it’s called “e-mist.” My boss packed the gaiwans up in the box you see behind them in the photo and put it all in an overead storage. Supposedly, just the exposed desk surfaces are misted, so theoretically anything above that level would be untouched.Having said all that, one of the gaiwans did have wet tea in it (it’s really dry here and it was overnight, so little chance for mold), and of course clay is porous and absorbs nearly everything. I mention this because it’s possible if any disinfectant reached this gaiwan, the wet tea would hold onto it.As a precaution, I would like to clean these out but I’m unsure how to proceed.  Originally, I thought placing each one separately in boiling water for about 30 minutes would do the job, but I’d like to get input before I proceed. These gaiwans are well on their way to being wonderfully seasoned, so I’d like to avoid anything that would undo that, but of course food safety is the priority in this situation.

colors**The botanical name for tea is Camellia sinensis, which comes from the family Camellia. This is the Chinese variety; in the northeast of India, a second variety known as Camellia assamica was discovered in the nineteenth century. The tea bush has leaves with finely serrated edges, with numerous oil glands. The flowers are white and have a delicate fragrance.&amp;#x200B;[ Tea Colours](The cultivation of tea requires a warm, humid climate, and cultivation at higher altitudes is considered to produce tea of superior quality, although factors such as the climate, soil, method of harvest, and processing also affect the tea quality.The majority of teas are made from young leaves. When the bush reaches the necessary maturity, leaves are picked by hand. For the highest quality teas, only the top three newest leaves are picked.After harvesting comes to the drying process. The leaves are spread out and left to wilt until they are very malleable and can be rolled without breaking. During this process is when the leaves release the substances that give them their characteristic color and smell.**The giant forest**In 1939, in the province of Yunnan in the southeast of China, a huge swath of wild tea trees were discovered. Some were more than 98 feet (30 meters) high with trunks 3 feet (a meter) in diameter. Their age is estimated to be around 1,700 years old.**Modern and classic teas**The custom of delicately flavored teas has been around for many years; however, fruity teas are a more recent trend and are often closer to an herbal infusion. The ideal choice is always a tea with a truly natural aroma and essence, such as those shown on these pages.**Green tea**&amp;#x200B;[Green tea]( is made by drying the leaves completely to avoid fermentation. It is the most common tea consumed in China and Japan. Along with white tea, it has the most proven therapeutic properties.Green tea tends to have a more delicate and herbal aroma. It has very little theine or caffeine; depending on the variety, the quantity may be between 8 and 16 mg per cup. By comparison, a cup of espresso can easily have more than 200 mg of caffeine. Here are some of the most highly regarded varieties:• Bancha. Alongside Sencha, although of lesser quality, it is the most common tea in Japan. Very low in theine.• Genmaicha. Green tea with toasted rice; is frequently drunk with meals by the Japanese.• Gunpowder. A Chinese tea with a strong flavor, which also appeals to fans of black tea. Often in the form of leaves compressed into a small ball.• Kokeicha. Three-year tea; is very valued in Japan. It is made by toasting very fine twigs four times. Then the twigs are pulverized and pressed into fine needles.• Kukicha. Made up of the stems of tea leaves, it makes a yellowish infusion with a distinctive flavor and very little theine.• Lung Ching. This tea is the lung ching (“dragonwell”). It comes from the lake region of Hangzho, China. It is celebrated for its emerald color and sweet taste.• Matcha. Powdered green tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony; yields a rich, astringent, jade-colored infusion.• Sencha. A Japanese classic. Also available in a decaffeinated version.Mu Tea. The so-called mu tea does not contain tea leaves; it is actually a unique mixture of sixteen plants and spices, revived in the last few decades from an ancient oriental tradition. It has a very particular taste and is wonderful for digestion. **Black tea**&amp;#x200B;[Black Tea]([Black tea]( is obtained through an oxidation process. Freshly harvested leaves are left in humid rooms so they ferment. This treatment lasts between three and five hours depending on the variety, which gives the tea its characteristic dark green or black color.Black tea has a strong flavor—closer to coffee—and can be combined with milk. It has a higher quantity of caffeine than green tea has. Each cup contains between 25 and 100 mg, depending on the degree of fermentation.Among the most popular varieties of black tea are:• [Assam]( A full-bodied tea with a warm brown color. The Camellia assamica—a different plant than Sinensis—is grown in the northeast region of India.• Ceilan. The ancient name for Sri Lanka is given to this delicate and aromatic black tea. It is commonly sold in bags.• Darjeeling. Called “the champagne of teas” for its delicate fragrance and flavor. It is grown on the slopes of the Indian Himalayas. It is also sold decaffeinated.• Earl Grey. Classic British mix of black tea with bergamot. It is one of the most commonly purchased bagged teas.**Leaves from the sky**The Darjeeling valley is found in the northeast region of India, on the border with Nepal. Eighty-seven tea plantations in this region have a 125-year history. The plant is grown at elevations between 1,970 and 7,050 feet (600 and 2,150 meters), on steep mountainsides that drain heavy monsoon rains.The tea that grows in this region is of unmatched quality, a bundle of it falling somewhere between sweet grapes and ripe peaches. Between April and May the First Flush is harvested, tender young teas that produce a very light infusion. The second harvest, or Second Flush, occurs in July and August, and produces a bright infusion with a more intense flavor. This is considered ideal for after-dinner drinks.&amp;#x200B;[leaves from Sky](• English Breakfast. Invented by a merchant in the nineteenth century, this is a very strong black tea to help you wake up in the morning.• Keemun. From Chinese, “mountain of the lion.” This is a very high-quality tea grown in the humid mountains of Anhui. Its aroma is like that of an orchid.• Kenya. Brightly colored and intensely aromatic, this is one of the black teas with the most body. It is grown at high altitudes in the African country and is usually sold as a powder.• Lady Grey. This is a more fruity—and feminine—version of Earl Grey. In addition to bergamot it contains rose petal and orange peel.• Lapsang souchong. This robust Chinese tea has a characteristic smoky taste, from the process of drying leaves over a wood fire.• Samovar. A very popular mixture developed in Russia from Chinese black tea with a touch of smokiness.• Sumatra. This is a black tea with an intense, but slightly sweet, flavor. It is grown in the Indonesian island of the same name.**Blue tea**This is the name sometimes given to semi-fermented teas, also called Oolong. Instead of completing the oxidation, the fermentation is stopped mid-process—usually after about two hours. The result is a tea halfway between green and black. It has a balanced flavor with a combination of the characteristics of green and black teas, and is very popular in Taiwan. The caffeine content depends on when the fermentation is interrupted and can vary from 10 to 55 mg per cup.**Yellow tea**The leaves of this tea are left to mature rather than ferment. These are varieties that are difficult to find commercially. Yellow tea takes its name from the color of the infusion it produces. It has a singular and defined taste that can be slightly bitter. Its fresh scent leaves the mouth clean and dry. Its flavor—somewhere between sweet and bitter—lingers on the tip of the tongue after drinking it.Chun Shan Yin Chin is considered the best and most valuable yellow tea. Mao-chien and Huang Da Cha are other popular varieties.**Red tea**There is some confusion about what is popularly known as “red tea.” The Chinese give this name to Pu-er, a variety of green tea that only grows in the Yunnan region and is fermented to darken it. This “tea of the Emperor,” so-called because it originally was reserved only for the highest offices of power, is frequently used in diets today because of its “fat-eliminating” qualities.Sometimes “red tea” is used to refer to Rooibos, a South African plant with a sweet taste and invigorating and healing properties, which belongs to a botanical family unrelated to tea.**White tea**White tea is grown in many parts of China. It is lightly fermented and gives a very lightly colored infusion. In some plants, the leaf appears to have a white fuzz. The buds are harvested just two days of the year, in spring, and are picked by hand. It takes approximately 80,000 buds to produce only 250 grams of tea; this is why the price is so high.The legend of the white teaPopular tradition tells that in ancient China, this type of tea was harvested exclusively by maidens with gold scissors, and only the emperor had the right to taste it. The location of the sacred gardens was itself a mystery, and those few who discovered it paid with their lives. Pai Hao Yin Chin is a fairytale about this white tea.In Fujian, there was once a drought so severe that nothing could be harvested for many seasons. Then a plague ravaged the country and many people died. The situation got worse and worse and the elders recommended they go search for a sacred plant that grew beside the well of a dragon, in a nearby mountain. The juice of this plant, they said, would bring back the land’s prosperity and cure the sick.Many brave young people from Fujian went to the mountains in search of this sacred plant, but none of them returned, since the well was guarded by a fierce black dragon. Two brothers and their sister decided to go on the search. The oldest was the first to go, but he did not return. The second departed and suffered the same fate. Finally, the younger sister decided to go in search of her brothers and the plant. When she got there, she found that the dragon had turned the men to stone. Using her wits, she managed to steal the plant and kill the dragon with an arrow. With a few drops of the sacred plants, she brought the men back to life and they returned to the town and planted the seeds. The land became fertile once more and the sick were healed.From that day on, all of the plants in Fujian, a province at an altitude of 6000 meters, were of white tea, which is grown there to this day.&amp;#x200B;White tea has a much softer taste and scent than the other teas, and it contains the least amount of theine: about 1 mg per cup. It is highly valued for its therapeutic properties since its antioxidant power is triple that of green tea. The most well-known varieties are Shou mei, Pai hao Yin chin, and Pai mu tan.**Aromatic teas**Normally these are made from lower-quality leaves. In western shops, they are most often mixed based on black tea, although there are some classics made with green tea like that jasmine—highly valued in China—or Japanese lime.Tea gourmets always prefer the pure varieties, but if they are to consume aromatic tea, they opt for flower accents.The fragrance of the flowers is incorporated into the leaves during processing.It is essential to achieve the right balance between tea and flowers so the fragrance does not cover the natural flavor of the tea. According to experts, the flower should make up about 30 percent of the taste and the tea should be the other 70 percent. In and of itself, the type of flower depends on the type of tea. Teas with a stronger flavor allow for the incorporation of more concentrated fragrances.The flowers most commonly used are jasmine, rose, lychee, and lotus. Tea Colors - Lelow Online"

invention st louis world fair iced history,1,9569,1620,"# The history of tea**A legendary origin**The first documents that mention [***tea***]( date back to the period between the seventh and sixth centuries BC. The inhabitants of ancient China in this period sang of the excellence of Tu, the name given to the group of plants which we now know as tea. This is the official origin, although if we give credit to popular legend, tea has been around since approximately the year 2700 BC. Between the years 206 BC and 221 AD, during the Han dynasty, improved methods of gathering and preparing tea leaves made tea a popular beverage of the royal family. Its prestige among the nobility grew, reaching its peak in the period of the Three Kingdoms (221–277 AD), when tea served as a substitute for wine at the court’s banquets.**Emperor Chen Nung**The French writer Maxence Fermine describes, in his novel Opium, the discovery of tea in China: “One day, more than four thousand years ago, the emperor Chen Nung was traveling with his guard through a distant region of his great country. As the journey was long and tiring, he ordered them to let him stop to rest in the shade of some trees to protect them from the sun. The convoy stopped and the emperor sat cross-legged under an unknown bush. Immediately, he asked for a bowl of boiling water, as he was thirsty and it was the best remedy he knew to quench his thirst. His servants hurried to bring it to him. At that moment, a leaf fell into the emperor’s bowl. Chen Nung drank the water without notice, and when he did a sweet yet bitter aroma filled his throat. Intrigued, he looked into the bowl and found the leaf that gave this fascinating scent and flavor. And thus tea was born.”&amp;#x200B;[Tea in China]( The general population would wait another five centuries before experiencing the goodness of this virtuous plant, since it wasn’t until the Tang dynasty, from 618 to 907 AD, that tea became the national beverage of China. Proof of this is that a philosopher of the time, Lu Yu, wrote the first account of its history, cultivation, and preparation in 780 AD: the Cha-Ching.”Tea’s reputation reached every corner of China, thanks to caravans of merchants that crisscrossed the country. In 705 AD, Camellia sinensis crossed borders for the first time and was introduced in Japan by a monk named Dengyo Daishi. During this same time period, tea arrived in Tibet and was a great success. There they boiled tablets of pressed tea and then mixed it with butter and salt. It wasn’t until the start of the twentieth century that tea in the form of infusion became popular there, although there are still many Tibetans that prefer the traditional preparation.**Tibetan style tea**In his memoir, Seven Years in Tibet, mountain climber Heinrich Harrer (played in the movie by Brad Pitt) describes the local custom of drinking tea mixed with yak lard, a combination that he found horrifying. The author commented that some Tibetans claimed to drink more than a hundred cups a day.**Beyond China**Tea had begun to cross borders at the beginning of the ninth century when the first shipments arrived by boat to Korea and Japan. There, a Buddhist monk called Yesai published the first Japanese book on tea in 1191. Both countries began to cultivate tea in the humid, mountainous regions, and their inhabitants soon learned of the therapeutic properties of the infusion. Zen monks incorporated tea in their routines in the temple, in combination with meditation that lasted all day.[Tea Collection -Black Green Burgundy white Tea](Regarding the union between Buddhism and tea, the legend tells that an Indian prince named Drama had decided to devote his life to prayer. Abandoning his home, he began a pilgrimage toward China and Japan. Exhausted from the hard days of journeying, he succumbed to a deep sleep along the banks of a river and slept for a long time. Upon waking, he felt horrified by his laziness and meted himself a severe punishment so as not to succumb to sleep again: he cut off his eyelids and buried them in the place where he had slept. Many years later, returning to his home, he passed that same place and discovered that a strange bush was growing where he had buried the eyelids. The monk chewed a few leaves and realized that they helped keep the mind awake. Since then, the Zen monks have always cultivated tea in the monastery gardens.**From “cha” to “tea”**The names given for the word “tea” are very similar throughout Asia: in Japan, it’s called cha, in Russia caj, in India tschaj and in China, ch’a. Some linguists maintain that it’s possible all these names come from the word for “vitality” in Chinese, chi.In the Fukien province of China, the Dutch learned the word tay, which means “tea” in the local dialect, and this sound was introduced to Europe. In fact, in Ireland and England, it was pronounced tay until the start of the eighteenth century, after which the word was derived to tee and then tea—as we know it today.In many European languages, the same word is used as a generic term for herbal teas or an infusion of herbs.Apart from making the most of tea’s curative properties, the Japanese nobles also began to include tea in their social meetings. Thus was born the Cha no yu, the tea ceremony, a delicate and demanding ritual lasting several hours, for which the hosts would have expensive and precious utensils.&amp;#x200B;[English Tea Preparation](**Tea arrives in the West**The first record of the existence of tea in the West dates to the year 851 AD. It was written by an Arab merchant named Suleiman in his book Relations in China and India, where he defined it as “an aromatic herb with a bitter taste that is drunk with boiled water in the East.”Apparently, westerners did not hear about this infusion again until 1529, when the Venetian Giambattista Ramusio wrote in his book Navigazione e Viaggi about the existence of a plant in the East that “calms pain of gout and also guarantees good stomach function.” Jesuit missionaries that visited China and Japan in the sixteenth century also spoke of a plant with a sweet taste that the natives called chai.[An Indian Old Man Enjoys Tea](**The East India Company**In the seventeenth century, the European powers competed to claim the new markets in Asia. During this process, the Dutch East India Company brought the first shipment of tea to Europe in 1606. Later, the ships of the English East India Company achieved a monopoly on tea and began to distribute it in France, Germany, and Portugal as well as England. In 1657, the first teahouse opened in London, and financial transactions involving the plant took place on its upper floors. But tea became popular in England a few years later, when King Charles II married Catalina de Berganza, a great fan of the beverage.The Portuguese princess brought with her dowry the port of Bombay, one of the most important hubs of maritime commerce between Asia and Europe, which became key in the tea trade between the two continents. The infusion began to be served in the court and, during the following century, became the most popular beverage in England, winning over even beer and gin.In 1834, the East India Company lost its monopoly on tea after the implementation of a British governmental resolution. With free competition between companies, the speed of the ships became more important, so large ships gave way to small, lightships called clippers. This produced true competition to be the first to arrive in port and be able to sell at the best price, resulting in all kinds of incidents and adventures on the high seas, as the typical passage took about a hundred days.The custom of adding milk to tea—so deeply entrenched in England today—was introduced by the Dutch in the early seventeenth century and then spread to France and England. The Japanese and Chinese never add milk to tea because they believe it ruins the flavor, original color, and aroma of the infusion.Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, tea was drunk at any time of day. The creation of the British afternoon tea—at five o’clock—is attributed to the Duchess of Bedford, who after drinking it in the afternoon with a snack found it so delicious she instituted the ritual with all her friends.[Mango Tea](**The spread of tea**In 1810 the Chinese began to cultivate tea on the island of Formosa, in modern-day Taiwan. A decade later in Assam, in the northeastern region of India, Robert Bruce and his brother discovered vast thickets of tea growing naturally and established the tea industry in the then-British colony, including the Darjeeling region.In other parts of the world, tea arrived under more difficult circumstances. In Ceylan, modern-day Sri Lanka, the cultivation of tea began in earnest after a plague affecting coffee trees devastated all the plantations on the island—at that time it was the second-largest producer of coffee in the world.[Collection of Tea Around the world](In each country, tea has been introduced differently, with many local variations. The Maghrebis, for example, inherited tea from the English and their national drink is mint tea. It is served in a glass with a lot of sugar and accompanied by honey cakes. Proper etiquette dictates that the host should drink at least three glasses of tea, with the last one being stronger than the previous.In 1900, with the inauguration of the Trans-Siberian railroad, tea was no longer transported by camel from Peking to Russia. And four years later, Richard Blechyden presented a refreshing invention at the St. Louis World’s Fair: iced tea. The history of tea"

hello advance client today talk think course tried always generic store bought think anything great year month ago quit drinking drinking much sugar making jittery drinking much would flavorful would require whole lot sugar anything biter thinking fruitiy really would something lower caffeine would alright think problem plan teal multiple day suggestion think might hot would nice day definitely upvote provide link,1,934,188,Hello and thank you in advance. I had a client today talk about tea and I think I want to try it. I of course have tried tea before but it was always generic store bought tea and I don't think there was anything great about it and it has been years. About 15 months ago I quit drinking coffee because I was drinking it with too much sugar and it was making me jittery by drinking so much. I would like to try a flavorful tea that would not require a whole lot of sugar to make it taste good but I don't want anything too biter. I'm thinking fruitiy but I really don't know what I would like. Something with lower caffeine would be alright but I don't think it will be a problem as I don't plan to drink teal like I did coffee and having multiple cups a day.  Is there any suggestions you think I might like as a hot drink would be nice some days. Definitely upvote from me if you provide a link. Again thank you. What Tea should I try

So today I went to Walmart and picked up some loose leaf infusers but found no good loose leaf tea. Now I would like to purchase some online that will meet a few requirements preferably. 1. Little to no caffiene 2. Loose leaf3. Not expensive (25 dollars for a few ounces)I'm not in the best spot financially but love tea and want to expand my knowledge of tea. So far I've mostly just ever had herbal from brands like celestial, stash, and Bigelow. I have found that some of these herbal teas are far too weak in flavor for me and end up just being slightly altered water. However some flavors such as Bengal Spice, or peppermint, have been absolutely wonderful when mixed into a sort of latte with milk and honey. I also really loved the decaf chai black tea from Bigelow. I am putting in an order for some earl grey and some English breakfast decaf from TheTeaKitchen and GoodlifeTea. Anything negative to say about these brands? Any brands I probably shouldn't buy from and brands I most definitely should buy from?Thank you and I'm sorry if this came off as obnoxious or rude in any way, just not doing too hot on money and also my anxiety gets worse with caffiene. Oh, and yes I am aware that shopping for good loose leaf at Walmart probably wasn't the wisest move, thank you :) Best decaf loose leaf online?"

I am a casual tea drinker in need of some assistance. For spring break, I travelled down to Florida to enjoy some sun. In the town I was staying at was a lovely tea and spice shop. I purchased some strawberry green tea to enjoy on my trip and to take home. Because I didn't expect to buy loose leaf tea during my vacation, I didn't bring my strainer and made due with my friend's coffee filters instead. It was the best green tea I've tasted in years. When I returned from my trip, I decided to brew another cup, this time with my kettle and strainer, instead of a microwave and coffee filter. Instead of the flavorful tea I was used to, it was bland. Was it my kettle? My strainer? They steeped for the same amount of time as it did in Florida. The bag for the tea is resealable so freshness shouldn't a problem.

Cold brewing in just water isn't bad, but it's lacking for me.Are there any low sugar or sugar free sweeteners that I can use in cold brewing? Outside of stevia, which I think tastes awful. I know there is simple syrup. But, if I was gonna dump that in tea, then I might as well just drink soda.Any advice would be appreciated. Low sugar or sugar free sweeteners for cold brewing?"

My face acne is getting worse and that aside, it’s rotting my teeth. I have REALLY good teeth, but if I keep drinking soda, I could gain major cavities. And my soda intake is BAD, I drink multiple sodas a day, and my room is literally filled to the brim with empty cans. However, that was days ago, now I’m drinking water and haven’t touched soda in, like, 2 days. Now, I probably won’t quit soda forever, but I want to definitely lower my intake and daily consumption, cutting it down to maybe one soda a week. And I feel tea could probably fill that role. Just like most users who are asking about tea for the first time, I’m SUPER inexperienced. I’ve never brewed or brought tea that wasn’t either Snapple or Gold Peak. I don’t even drink tea period, wasn’t my forte. However, i think I want to make the switch if it’ll be better than soda, since I know I can’t keep drinking water forever, I’ll eventually go cold Turkey sooner or later, and the cravings are sort of coming back. The question is… where do I start? I’m a student in HS, so having a cup every day would be nice. I don’t know if I’ll buy tea online unless I get really invested. There is a Trader Joe’s near me and I read somewhere on the subreddit that TJ has good tea selections. Is brewing it hard, how do you get over the bitterness and not get tempted to put sugar, cream or milk in it? Should I go for honest teas in the meantime until I find good “brewed” teas?

It'll be 1pm and I'll have a whole fit about whether or not I can start a new gong fu session or if that's gonna mess with my sleep.This study is a few years old and I haven't seen much else on it in the research (I spent an hour or so yesterday looking) but it *does* seem to be one of the larger caffeine-impact studies that I could find in terms of population, but it was short term (&gt;700 people, about a week of sleep on average). It's based on a self-reported survey and was a population of African Americans. Still, I can now rest easy (no pun intended) when I decide that, yes, I do want to crack open that cake even though I'm finished with dinner. Good news, folks: we can drink without fear of insomnia"

I'll be speaking with my doctor next week, but one potential cause of this is that black tea can block iron absorption.I love my black tea in the mornings and would miss it intensely if I can't have it.

I'm looking to kill two birds with one stone and pick whatever has the most health benefits, and decent quality on a budget.I tried googling a bit, but most of what I've read is contradictory. Some sites say green tea is the healthiest, others say that rooibos is better, and some are talking about green rooibos (which I've never heard of). I've also been reading some controversial reports about lead and other heavy metals in tea, but it seems like a highly debated topic. It's all left me a little lost on what is ""good"" versus ""bad"".In any event, I used to get tea from Stash in the past. They have an organic loose Rooibos from South Africa and an organic green tea sourced in Brazil with a decent price (under USD$10 for 100g). Are these good teas or should I be looking elsewhere?

There are some wonderful travel gongfu sets out there these days, but I'm wondering if there's anything out there that can really keep a container of near-boiling water for a few hours.Lets say I boil water at home, put it in a pre-warmed vessel, travel 0.5-1.5 hours, hike for an hour, and then want to make a pu'er to share with my friend(s) (so at least 500-700ml). In a typical thermos I'm skeptical that the water will remain close enough to boiling to be useful, though peraps for a green or oolong, maybe black if the trip is on the shorter side. A video demonstration from Zojirushi shows about 40 degrees drop from boiling in 6 hours, so if we can assume linear drop, that means -20 degrees after 3hr, bringing it to about green/oolong territoryThere exist car-lighter powered boilers, but I often won't be traveling in a car. [Another redditor explained why it's unlikely a USB powered kettle would exist]( but this also assumes you're boiling water from scratch, I think it wouldn't be so bad if you were using fairly hot water like in the above scenario and using a heating element to slow the temperature drop...Which brought me to the existence of temperature controlled travel mugs, but from what I can see these are also almost all car-powered, though a few battery powered ones are out there but they mostly top out around 140F.Lastly there's the camping approach, but almost any fuel stove and pot to boil water will be bigger than the entire travel gongfu set, so unless I was actually camping I think this would be untenable for an enjoyable hike.Anyone have any other ideas? Have I unfairly discounted one of the above approaches? Or does anyone have experience trying this? Maybe the tried and true thermos is ""good enough""... I know I can always lower my expectations, but if it's possible, I'd love to make it happen. Gongfu on the go (ie hiking) - whats the best solution for boiling hot water? Do actively heated ones exist?"

I don't have the best experience with it let's say, let me explain.So I wanted to start drinking tea/black coffee like a year ago, and introduced the both of them gradually to my diet. I didn't like black coffee at first but over time, I learned to love it (it tastes great to me now). For tea however, I haven't introduced it to the same extent, probably because my parents don't drink them = don't buy em.I drank ginger tea as a child and that was somewhat traumatic as a kid. Started chamomile tea a year ago (thinking I'd like it) but it only tasted like.... flowers? I onlt had like 5 cups. I've pretty much only had like 8 cups of hot tea throughout my life, which probably impacted its taste for me.I want to drink more of it and get its acquired taste, just like I had with coffee. Don't know where to start though. I'm thinking green tea is a safe start but then again my knowledge about this all is limited. Any help is appreciated, thank you! Where to start?"

Wondering if people could recommend some to try, particularly black teas, as I feel that's the one tea I am underrating the most. Teas tried before:Black: Smoked Lapsang Souchong (absolutely loved it), Keemun (not really a fan, have tried medium and high quality, it's doable with milk).Oolongs (likely my favourite type): Da Hong Pao (loved &amp; have a ton), Rou Gui (loved), Dongfang Meiren, Tie Guan Yin, and Pheonix Oolong (all three liked quite a bit). White: Silver Needle (decent, oddly preferred lower quality than high due to astringency). Green: Dragon Well (decent, good at room temp with rock sugar), Organic Green (meh). Pu'er: Golden Pu'er (really liked, even with the fishy smell).Not sure if that helps for a flavour profiling, but I seem set for Oolongs, and I guess I don't really like Green or White (though will keep some on hand for the lightness), and I will likely need to pick up a decent Pu'er when I get an YiXing tea pot. But black tea really seems to be the tea that I likely would like but am short on. Black Tea Recommendations"

I’m relatively new to wine but I’ve been drinking it in - literally and intellectually - a lot in the past few months, and I’ve noticed that the aroma of different wines left at the bottom of the empty glass are not unpleasant, and are very different from each other and the wines that used fill the glasses. I can pick out distinct notes, and to my nose, they can broaden the wine’s flavor profile. They can even sometimes show if a winemaker was cutting corners by adding artificial flavors to a cheaper wine.Why I even considered taking this practice semi-seriously: I also like drinking tea in the traditional Chinese style known as gongfu. A big part of enjoying your tea this way is smelling your empty cup (or gaiwan) after you have finished it. All of the antioxidants, oils, and flavor compounds are the most concentrated and fragrant when your cup is empty, and it produces a warmer, richer nose than any other way to smell tea, be it the wet leaves or the the drink itself. The name for this is bēi xiāng, and it is a fundamental part of tea tasting.I haven’t found that wine drinkers often include this in the process of their own tasting and aside from cultural differences and practices from the east to the west, I suspect it’s because wine and tea are very different kinds of beverages, and wine oxidizes very quickly when there is a high surface area to volume ratio. That being said, the multitudes of flavor compounds are still there, only a minority of them oxidize straightaway, and the alcohol does the same evaporative legwork that a heated gaiwan does in concentrating the aroma. More importantly, in this novice’s opinion (who hardly has a grasp on any of the science behind this) the empty glass smells quite good, better than the actual wine smells in a few cases.Let me know what you, think, and if I’m completely talking out of my ***, let me know why I’m wrong so we can all learn together :) Smelling Empty Wine Glasses"

I'm a pretty passionate coffee guy, and have recently developed an interest in tea. I have been watching some resources on YouTube, Mei Leaf for the most part, and I have some ideas i would like to discuss with some people that know much more about tea than i do.   So, after i had gotten my quality tea, i still wasnt happy about how the tea tasted. It was full of bitterness and left my tongue very dry, I'm assuming those are the tannins working their magic. I therefore troubleshooted my process and turned out im brewing with too much leaf for too long, and in one of those tea balls. I then watched Mei Leafs video where he showed off the \[Conniseur Tea Brewer\]([ and i thought ""My, oh my, that works a lot like some coffee brewers that are very popular, the \[Hario Switch\]([ (timelapse where you can see easily how it works), or the Clever Dripper. They are basically holders for a coffee filter with a valve at the bottom. You rinse your filter, put in your coffee and water and let it infuse french press style, and then you open the valve after the desired brew time to release the coffee through the paper filter and into the cup. I then thought to myself ""How is this different to what that tea brewer is doing?"", and that is where you guys come in.   Would the Hario Switch be a viable tea brewer?   Is filtering tea through a (pre rinsed) coffee filter a bad thing?   Do you see any other problems using these brewers?   Do you see any overlap between tea and coffee?  Also, just for the heck of it, any fun tips for my tea journey? A coffee guys bright idea while getting into tea"

The leaves/buds seem like any ol green tea, maybe a little less vibrant. I don't know if I even see any buds in there for that matter. There's nothing white about it, nor are there those hairs that I thought there would be.

So if your doing gong fu style and your putting 4 teaspoons of tea that swells up in it. Can you put in 6 ozs water if you measure it and put it in and the infuser is big does that count as part of the 6 ozs too? I'm bout to buy a tiny glass one for gung fu. When I use my 12 oz double wall glass cup with glass infuser when I put tea leaves in and pour 6 ozs into its pretty close to top. When I take it out it's only half or 6 ozs. So my question is if I want to end up with 6 oz tea to come out of glass teapot with infuser. Can I use a 6 oz teapot or do I need 8 or 10 or 12 ozs. This is only for gong fo what is a 6 oz teapot?

sad last two year absolute fiend obsessive unhealthy level lmao white green oolong pu er matcha black name loved drank day every time went supermarket would walk aisle literally inhale scent would even frequently eat leaf wet dry anyway say huge part life really imagine going without january year contacted covid mild fortunately time drinking hydralyte never lost sense smell point initially worried ever since one lingering effect completely lost appetite would even go far say thought almost repels go every type smell different feel brain flicked switch decided enjoy think drunk since january enjoy much favorite milk oolong sencha strange honestly sad hope one day enjoy used happened anyone else lost appetite covid anyone else experience,1,1360,252,"Very sad :(So for the last two years I was an absolute tea fiend. Like, to obsessive, unhealthy levels lmao. White/green/oolong/pu-er/matcha/black you name it, loved it. Drank 5 cups a day, every time I went to the supermarket would walk through the tea aisle literally just to inhale the scent; would even frequently eat the leaves, wet or dry.Anyway, all that to say tea was a huge part of my life, and I couldn't really imagine going without it. Then January this year, contacted covid. Was very mild fortunately. During that time was only drinking water/hydralyte. Never lost my sense of smell or taste at any point (which is what I was initially worried about)-- but ever since, the one lingering effect is that I have completely lost my appetite for tea. Would even go so far as to say the thought of tea almost repels me. This goes for every type of tea. And it's not like they smell any different than before, it's just I feel my brain flicked a switch and decided not to enjoy it any more. I think I've only drunk 2 cups since January and I didn't enjoy them much at all. They were some of my favorites too (milk oolong, sencha). It's just so strange to me, and honestly it makes me so sad. I hope one day I can once again enjoy tea like I used to. Had this happened to anyone else? Lost appetite for tea after COVID, anyone else with this experience?"

I had a bit of tea that was opened maybe 4 months ago, and I ended up tossing it because I want to have the best experience given how restricted my tea intake can be.  Gotta live it up when your body lets you!  But I wonder if I was being a bit too cautious/pessimistic about how the tea would taste.  Hibiki-An's website says that their UNOPENED tea retains freshness for 6 months.  Was it reasonable to open a new pack or would you normally use unoxidized green tea that has been open for several months?  I keep it in original packaging tightly folded with a clip.  I may start putting the pack in a second container to keep out air even more. What's the longest you would store opened sencha/when do you notice deterioration?"

I find that the standard method of brewing iced tea in one huge batch and steeping it for 5 minutes or more does a disservice to the flavor of the tea, usually in the form of an overly tannic/bitter finish.  Sometimes traditionally-brewed iced tea is drinkable, but for me, iced tea made the typical way is never *great*. The method I'm sharing here makes a far better iced tea, and borrows its main principles from gong fu style brewing ( it uses more leaf, less water, shorter steeps). It requires more hands-on time, and it does use ***a lot more tea*** than the standard iced tea method,  but the overall amount of time it takes me to make iced tea this way is actually a bit less than the ""standard"" way and the flavor is going to be incredible. If you're someone who likes to make iced tea out of high-quality leaves, I think you'll appreciate that you're getting a more true-to-flavor beverage this way. This approach produces full-flavored iced tea with excellent dimension, color, and body with no bitterness. It works equally well for black, oolong, green, and white teas, and it also produces great results with flavored and scented teas.   **Supplies:***To brew tea this way, you'll need:*  1. Loose leaf tea — whatever kind of tea you like will work, just not teabags. 2. A glass pitcher for iced tea. I use an 800mL (\~28 oz.) glass pitcher. I recommend shooting for 750mL-800mL for this method, particularly if you are using flavored or scented teas. You want to be able to fill this container with 2-3 steeps; after that, flavored tea can get a weird and bland IME. If you're brewing with pure teas, you could go bigger if  you wanted since those tend to hold up through more steeps. 3. A 350mL-500mL teapot with strainer. You can go bigger if you want, but I very strongly recommend steeping no more than 400mL of tea at once and doing multiple steeps. Doing it this way will get you more dimension in the flavor of your finished product. I also recommend a strainer that is large enough to allow enough room for your tea leaves to open up fully.  4. A kitchen scale 5. An electric kettle with variable temperature settings (optional, but it does make this a lot easier)*I have recs for the tea pitcher and the teapot w/ strainer if you need them, but I don't want to post those here so people don't mistake me for a teaware shill. And if you already own stuff that's pretty close to what I'm describing, it will work great! But if you want to know what I'm using, send me a message and I'll happily tell you.*  **Instructions:**1. Using the tea amounts specified below, add the leaf to your pot.2. Heat your water to the temps specified below. Add the heated water to your pot 350mL to 400mL at a time.3. Steep according to the time chart below based on your tea. You will need to do 2-3 steeps to fill an 800mL4. **I do not add ice to the pitcher!** I only add ice to my glass when I'm ready to pour a glass of tea. And I always chill the tea in the fridge first. I like to make the tea the night before I plan on drinking it and chilling the tea in the fridge overnight. **TEA AMOUNT (per 100mL of water)*** *I'm usually brewing around 350mL of tea at a time, so for example, if I were making green tea, I use 14g of tea leaf, which is 3.5 x 4g. If I were brewing 400mL at a time, then I would use 16g of tea.** *These numbers are approximate, it's okay to go a little more or less, depending on your tastes.*   *White:*   4g\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Green:*   4g\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Oolong:*   6g\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Black:*   4g\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_&amp;#x200B;**WATER TEMPS**  *White:*   90C / 175F\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Green:*   80C / 175F\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Oolong:*   95C / 205F\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Black:*   90C / 195F\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_&amp;#x200B;**STEEP TIMES (in SECONDS, not minutes!)*** *I don't rinse my leaves before making iced tea, so I'm not including any rinse times here** *If you're using pearl style tea you might need to add a little time to the first steep to give the balls time to unfurl, but I admittedly haven't iced any pearl teas yet so I don't have any specific recommendations on timing for those** *These are the times that work best for me, but you can adjust according to your preference. But we're working with seconds, not minutes — and I promise you're going to get a full flavored tea because you're using such high ratio of leaf to water.*  *Black:*   1st Steep: 25  | 2nd Steep: 30 |  3rd Steep: 35\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Green:*   1st Steep: 15  | 2nd Steep: 20 |  3rd Steep: 25\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Oolong:*   1st Steep: 20  | 2nd Steep: 25 |  3rd Steep: 30\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*Black:*   1st Steep: 25  | 2nd Steep: 30 |  3rd Steep: 35\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ My personal method for consistently perfect iced tea"

I'm used to drinking (and enjoying) cheap tuochas, and this is my first time trying ""the good stuff"".I brewed it like I usually do: water at or near boiling point for 5 minutes. I was significantly underwhelmed, and couldn't imagine doling out $75 or whatever for a cake of this stuff.Then, I read a web page that recommended brewing raw pu'er at 190F for 3 minutes (like an oolong). (I also increase the steeping time by 30 seconds for each re-infusion.) This method is a *huge* improvement. I still don't think that I'd ever buy a cake of this stuff, but brewing it too hot definitely ruined the taste.Apparently, you can get away with brewing ripe pu'er at a much higher temperature, though. (Similar to a black tea.)If there are any pu'er scholars out there who can weigh in with further advice, it would be much appreciated. What do you think about increasing the steeping time with every re-infusion (for all teas and pu'er specifically)? It seems to help to get more flavor out of the leaf without ruining the taste. Pu'er advice?"

I will certainly be ordering more of these two. The Honey Black Tea was also nice and while I still enjoyed the Assam, it was my least favorite of the three black teas. As far as the Oolongs are concerned, I enjoyed the more oxidized ones more than the lightly oxidized Taiwan Four Seasons, which I wouldn't have been able to distinguish from a Green Tea. I didn't like the two Green Teas very much. Finally I had a free sample of a charcoal roasted Four Seasons Oolong which I thought was nicer and more full-bodied than the regular Four Seasons Oolong.Based on this, what teas would you recommend?
