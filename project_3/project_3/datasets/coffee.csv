Kruve recommends that grind sizes to be from 400Œºm to 1200Œºm. So I started grinding 8 grams of beans with 30 clicks away (CCW) from the zero setting of the Comandante.The result wasn't very satisfying and lots of coarser grounds remained in the upper chamber of the Kruve sifter. Below you can find my best results. Also note that my coffee beans are a medium roast blend from a local roastery.

Comandante setting: 22 clicks
8 gr of beans
0.75 gr waste (mostly coarser than 1200Œºm grounds)

Comandante setting: 20 clicks
8 gr of beans
0.57 gr waste (mostly finer than 400Œºm grounds)

Comandante setting: 19 
8 gr of beans
0.48 gr watse (almost only finer than 400Œºm grounds)

And so, going against some people's advice, I tried using a food processor (blender) to get it finer and finer. The coffee became extra fine and the coffee machine started to choke (the pressure gauge with the Baratza grind only goes up to 5\~7 bars of pressure while going over 10 with the finer grind), with a minimum of 25 seconds of brew time and some going over 1 minute for a 1:2 ratio. But I've watched a few videos online and it seemed as if the grind they were using weren't much finer than what my Baratza grinder was putting out.

76,Coffee,"I'm looking for a new grinder. Specifically, I'm looking to switch from a hand grinder to an electric grinder. I'll try to give you guys as much information on my current grinding and brewing:

I currently own an 1Zpresso JX Pro hand grinder. I'm quite happy with it as it produces vastly better distributions than the cheap Hario grinder I used before and because it's easy to use. I opted for a hand grinder because it's better value for money in terms of grinding performance and I didn't know yet how far I was going to go with my ""coffee game"". I only make filter coffee at the moment.

There are two reasons why I wish to buy a new grinder that is electric:

1) As I use my grinder that much and I expect to be grinding more often for more than one cup at a time, the convenience of an electric grinder is something I'd value greatly.

2) While I know that my current grinder is pretty good, there's room to grow. So as my experience and ""brewing skills"" grow, I thought I'd make an investment into my hobby by buying a good electric grinder that could last me for a bit.

A couple of things that may be relevant for which grinder to choose:

- I live in Europe (Switzerland), so I can only buy what can be shipped to Germany or Switzerland and I can only use a machine with the correct voltage.

- As mentioned, I currently only make filter coffee, not espresso but I could imagine switching to espresso at some point (once I can afford it).

- Needless to say, I'd wish for an improvement in performance compared to my current grinder, so entry level electric grinders in a similar price range as my grinder would be out of the question.

- If I choose a filter focused grinder, I'd want it to be able to reliably grind fine enough. I remember Hoffmann's review of the Fellow Ode, saying that he worries that it doesn't grind fine enough for a one cup V60. My Aeropress and Moka pot are even finer than my one cup V60, so maybe a grinder that is made to be able to do espresso but able to do filter well as well would be good (?), something like the Niche.

79,Coffee,"So I've been using the common setup with the C40 and the V60 for years, and one thing that always bugged me about the C40 was the way the burr would grow a ""beard"" of fines, and also lots of them sticking to the side of the jar. I solved this by releasing one drop of water in the beans before grinding them, in order to kill off all the static electricity and not waste any coffee or do extra cleaning after each use, but yesterday evening I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/l2asYfh-Apk?t=747) from European Coffee Trip (video should start at 12:27), where they say that it is actually a good idea to let the static electricity build up and avoid knocking out the fines from the grinder, so that they have less chance of adding bitterness to the cup.

106,Coffee,"I recently got curious about flat-bottom drippers, and picked up the Blue Bottle dripper because it seemed to have worked out some of the quirks of the Wave and other similar units. I brewed two cups today, and thought I'd share my results! 

First cup was a medium-light Ethiopian natural I roasted at home. In the V60, I was getting pretty balanced cups but maybe a touch under extracted. In the Blue Bottle Dripper, (BBD, henceforth) as soon as I lifted the dripper off the cup I was smacked in the face by the aroma of hot sugar. (Think cotton candy.) Flavor-wise, it was what you expect from an Ethiopian natural. Jammy, aggressively floral. My favorite thing about it was the body, though. I've never had a cup of filter coffee that was so syrupy! It was pretty high strength, and veeery high extraction at ~24%. 

Second cup was a darker roasted blend I bought from a new coffee shop in the area. It's the one they brew in house for filter coffee, and I think it's a great example of a specialty dark roast! (Dark-ish, really.) I didn't measure extraction, but I was still impressed. There was a candy banana note I never tasted in my V60 or Aeropress cups, and again, much heavier body. This could be down to different filter paper, but either way, I like it! 

My personal experience with the V60 is that you usually have to trade high extraction for clarity. You can get a sweeter cup, but usually with less flavor separation than a bright cup. So far, it seems like you don't make that trade with the BBD. 

A few caveats: with only two brews down, I may find things to dislike about the dripper with time. Coming from a plastic V60, I'm nervous about dropping or breaking. Some coffees may benefit from a bit lower EY, and I don't know if that will be easy to do on the BBD. Also, it doesn't fit neatly on the glass body of my French Press, which I usually use as a server. For all that, though, I'm super stoked to explore what it can do!

Currently, I‚Äôm using this AeroPress recipe https://www.javapresse.com/blogs/aeropress/aeropress-espresso-recipe which can do a semi-decent job, but I‚Äôd like to upgrade to something that can actually pull real espresso shots.

I know as a blind person I right off the bat have to stay away from machines with touch screens and capacitive buttons. My preference is to also stay away from anything that relies on any sort of app or Wifi connectivity.

I‚Äôve used a moka pot in the past and wasn‚Äôt a real fan. I also don‚Äôt need something with all sorts of bells or whistles like an integrated grinder, frother and scale as I already have a Baratza Virtuoso and accessible kitchen scale.

I was gifted a Ninja coffee maker for Christmas that had all sorts of functions, but it unfortunately had one of those capacitive buttons with a menu you had to cycle through to pick what you wanted to do. There was no way I could use it.

I know you can go down the rabbit hole when it comes to espresso, but I‚Äôd like to keep my budget around $600 max.

Having been exclusively a tea drinker for all my adult life, I've recently decided to put my toe in the water of coffee...what a revelation, flavour!

Moka Pot coffee is of course somewhat stronger than an Americano and I've been adding around 80ml of hot milk, to bring me up to my usual 120z cup of joe!

However, reading on other sites, it appears that the 6-cup moka is really aimed at two people, with the 3 cup Moka Pot recommended for one person.

My friend has an Appia at their coffee shop that had a steam leak from the vacuum pressure valve (no biggie, disassembled it, cleaned it and reinstalled it)

However, when I asked them to turn the machine on again - to check for any pressure leaks during warm up, the pump would engage and disengage with that audible ‚Äòclick‚Äô multiple times..(in my thought process from owning a Victoria Arduino Adonis) this would happen once to allow the boiler to refill to the required level before heating the water, however with my friend‚Äôs machine, it seemed to just constantly click [engage] on(or off?) repeatedly for 10-20 mins. With a frequency of 3-5seconds between each pulse (engagement).

I presume that there may be either a problem with the pump itself, an associated solenoid (or the [Auto-level Sensor - Part # 09000003]) however, rather than just changing parts here and there (a layman repair technique), I was wondering if anyone has had a similar problem, and could provide either insight (about the problem, symptoms and solution) or to clarify a way to accurately diagnose if this is the case?

For example - is there a voltage / resistance that can be measured with a multimeter to check that the sensor is indeed working, and if the voltage / resistance is fluctuating correctly with the operation of the machine?

The rapid engaging / disengaging (off and on -&gt; ‚Äòclicking‚Äô) isn‚Äôt actually adding water to the boiler at all, and I suspect that it is impeding the warm-up time of the machine, and potentially wearing out the pump with it‚Äôs intermittent operation.

I'm currently looking at a used Gaggia Coffee Deluxe being sold near me for $75.

Between this and a used Flair NEO for the same price, which is more capable, steam wand aside?
I've heard it's similar to the Gaggia Classic but without the 3 way valve. I won't need that if I'm just looking at doing plain ol' double shots, right?
Same with the frothing wand, I'm an iced shaken espresso and iced latte drinker because... Texas, so if the wand has issues will it impact the whole thing, or is it fine?
What sort of issues should I be on the lookout for in terms of fixing/replacing? Are replacement parts still readily available or will it be a new old stock situation?
My current grinder is a trusty Porlex Mini that fits in my aeropress (it goes with me home, to hotels, to friends houses, the like)... will that on the finest settings be sufficient for the time being? Or would I be better off looking for a dedicated espresso grinder secondhand? I'm a college student so my budget is sort of limited for anything nicer.

There was a fiery debate about the definition of iced coffee so I'll TLDR that for you here as to my definition: Coffee that is traditional hot brewed, then cooled (preferably quickly) and then once cooled, poured over ice and drank.

After many months of experimenting with both at home I have come to a realization about cold brew: It comes out SO MUCH better (IMO) when you use a light roast. I've been doing a 96 hour steep in the fridge, and have been coming to realize that when you use a darker roast it starts to taste further from what I associate with a ""coffee"" flavor, whereas when you use a medium or light roast there are a lot more flavors that come through. I'm not a fan of those Trader Joe's cold brew concentrates - and I find that that's what the darker roast CBs come to taste like.

Not a forever convert, I like to switch off between both CB and IC (TBH I'm a sucker for a standard black Starbucks Iced Coffee - they really have it down), but certainly less of a CB hater now.

So I have a big steel french press, it comfortably makes two full mugs and its full capacity was listed (by the seller on Amazon) as 1.2 L. I really like steel because glass cracks easily in the dishwasher.

I also have a Krups burr grinder. So I expected some nice coffee - but am failing to make it. Instead, it's either watery or bitter.

The Internet (tm) says use coarser grinds, somewhat large amounts of coffee, limit brewing to 5 minutes. But it gets bitter. Smaller amounts with a coarse grind get watery; with a finer grind, bitter again.

I did also start preheating the steel french press first by keeping some freshly-boiled water in it, covered, for a minute while rocking the press. Things got somewhat better but not a lot.

So what's the secret here? How can I work out the formula for coffee that would be full-bodied but not bitter?

I did google now and there is that James Hoffman video with the idea of stirring after a  few minutes and then just throwing away what remains on top. Not sure this makes sense to me as the stirring already distributes all the bitter stuff? Maybe I should stir at the start of the brewing, then just take the top off after the (4 minute?) brewing before the plunging? Or what else do I do, anyway?","Steel french press, burr grinder - how to make nice and not bitter coffee?",1652294805,True

coarser grind and multiple pours VS fine grind and single pour (after bloom)

this always intrigued me as to the fundamental differences between the two

james hoffman/ scott rao seems to prefer the single pour, while we have all seen brewers cup champion recipes mainly doing multiple pours

my understanding is that coarser grinds act as a ""safety net"" to avoid over-extraction in several ways

* lower temperature, heat loss is greater when you allow the water to drain before pouring again
* coarser grinds less prone to overextraction
* a bed with coarser grinds channel less

downside is that you are putting a ceiling on the flavours available for extraction as you are leaving some coffee unavailable for extraction at the centre of the coarser grinds.

\- shall i replace silicon rings in group head? (attaching image below - there is thick red one and thin one inside group head that are quite hard at the moment and not the flexible anymore. is it worth changing?)

\- from the image attached below - how could i clean the limescale? back flushing doesn't help and i do not want to scratch/damage it. hard brush that came together with machine does not work either. soaking with solution is impossible - hard place to soak in

Which product is best suited for making espresso? Some of them -&gt;J-Max, Jx Pro, K-Max, Comandante C40, Molent,Timemore X etc.

How  many microns will I need for each click to extract all flavours from  coffee beans and get a well-balanced taste with good complexity and  body? 8.8(J-Max), 12,5 (Jx Pro), 15(comandante with red clix, or 30  without it), 22 ( K-Series) etc. Which product will best combined with  the Picopresso? which one offers long-last using? These are some of my  questions. While struggling with the question, I watched a comparison  (the link is below) of Comandante and Jx-Max in terms of making espresso  today.

I will probably prefer the  Comandante option even if it requires more effort than others. After  this long consideration, I just wanted to share this comparison video  that helped me decide what to do. I will be grateful if you let me know  your comments about my decision.

I've also had a Hario Switch that I've gotten decent results out of, though I've never really liked its lack of heat retention. Recently, I've just decided to try my plastic V60 cone that I got off of Amazon with the supposedly shitty tabbed V60 filters that came with my Switch, and... all my brews have been good?

The taste does vary, of course, which I expected, but they've all been *good*, which is what I considered important.

600,Coffee,"This may be a longshot, but I need help identifying this beast. it's a single-cup commercial-grade coffee machine that was in the kitchen nook at the printing company my family used to own, up until it closed in 2004. This is the only image I have of the absolute unit. I can remember it was hooked to a double-filtered tap supply and despite having a bunch of different menu settings, was only ever used for regular and decaf coffee. I asked my father and grandmother and both can't remember what brand it was, but that it was acquired in the mid-90s through a restaurant supplier, of whom also delivered to them regular 6-month shipments of Lacas coffee, ketchup/mustard packets, sugar packets, and the usual assortment of pink/yellow/blue sweetener packets to boot.

In its lifetime it only ever broke down once, and it was something to do with a manufacturer defect in a seal that led to quite a bit of water on the floor-- covered under service warranty, of course. aside from this, it was a workhorse, and the employees who frequented it had the machine dialed in for a perfect 8oz cup every time (or so says my grandmother). I can partly blame this machine for my love of coffee today, as I was an early enjoyer (for the time) at 8 years old. As a kid with the ADHD type that calmed down with caffeine, coffee was my savior, no matter what it tasted like.

Despite the image depicting such, the machine was not coin-op enabled, and the coin/change mechanism was disabled if it had it installed to begin with, something that slips my own memory. I can remember it taking a time to warm up, and I think it used straight-up pre-ground coffee as I do remember the inside having a waste grounds container. However, I can't make out the brand label on the front-top-left to save my life, and my google-fu must be weak in this field as I'm not able to find any images of commercial-grade machines from this era to get even an inkling of what brands to look at. 

Honestly I'm doing this for nostalgia's sake, to get some better pictures and even a video if it exists. I'm sorry for the graininess of the image, it was taken on a 3.2MP Kodak camera of the time and not on the highest quality setting it could have been. If this looks in any way shape or form familiar to anyone, or if anyone has any clues toward which brand to look at, it would help a lot towards the removal of a headscratcher I've had for a couple of years now.

If this isn't the right subreddit to post this in, a recommendation of where to crosspost it would also be beneficial. I don't know if r/cafe would be more proper but it is 4AM and I'm losing sleep over this.

I while back I got really into maple lattes after watching a coffee shop on tv who are known for them. I found the flavor combination to be delicious but when I tried remaking it myself I came across an issue, the maple flavor was to delicate you could hardly taste it and I only got the maple syrup flavor on the back end.

After some research, I found that the maple flavor comes from the darker syrups, not only the darker syrups but also syrups extracted from later in the season. I don't use artificial maple syrups and I wouldn't say I buy the top quality since it can get pricey.

This being said, I had the idea of maybe adding maple extract to maple syrup itself and then continuing to use it as a syrup for my lattes. Will this add a weird maple flavor to the latte or can this actually enhance the maple flavor of the syrup itself to make it a little more dominate in the final product?

I was planning to pair it with a Mignon Classic Manuale/Silenzio (and a non pressurized filter if it doesn't come with one ofc), but this is where I started to wonder about how much the grinder would matter if it's almost 100% milk drinks and never straight up shots, and if I would be better of with just a lower end grinder like the SGP or even their dose control (which I could get from an another place in a pack where the machine is essentaly the same discounted price).

739,Coffee,"Hi everyone. I recently tried espresso for the second time today, and I didn't really enjoy it either time. Both times I've tried it have been at the same specialty-coffee-like cafe. It seemed quite unpleasant, and what I think might be astringent, though I'm not 100% sure what that means. I hoped the second time would allow my palate to grow accustomed to it, but seemingly no luck. In my mind this could be due to 1 of 3 different options:

1) My sense of taste isn't yet accustomed to the strong flavour, and I need some time to get used to espresso
2) I don't like espresso, and should stick to filter coffee and milk drinks
3) the cafe doesn't make very good espresso

757,Coffee,"Good morning everyone,

I while back I got really into maple lattes after watching a coffee shop on tv who are known for them. I found the flavor combination to be delicious but when I tried remaking it myself I came across an issue, the maple flavor was to delicate you could hardly taste it and I only got the maple syrup flavor on the back end.

After some research, I found that the maple flavor comes from the darker syrups, not only the darker syrups but also syrups extracted from later in the season. I don't use artificial maple syrups and I wouldn't say I buy the top quality since it can get pricey.

This being said, I had the idea of maybe adding maple extract to maple syrup itself and then continuing to use it as a syrup for my lattes. Will this add a weird maple flavor to the latte or can this actually enhance the maple flavor of the syrup itself to make it a little more dominate in the final product?

I'm now thinking, however, to only serve batch brew (for now). The thing is, I'd rather avoid the costs of an espresso set-up, the cost of hiring someone else to help at the front, and the possibility that the coffee might not always be the greatest because of time pressure. But with batch brew, my partner could serve, make cups of batch brew, and also help in the kitchen. No other employee needed. 

Of course, I'd make sure there's space to buy an espresso machine later on, when we're in a certain flow running the business, and we're in a position to hire more people. But for the beginning, I was thinking we could just focus on high quality filter, and give a choice of two roast types (light/medium) - of course having two batch brewers, which I think would still be cheaper than an espresso set up.

I have a gas camping stove which I'm planning to use to test the siphon, but does anyone know how safe it would be to use the siphon on my electric ceramic (not induction) hob? 

I've tried to look around online and can't find many people discussing the Cona stove top models. I've seen a little discussion about Cory and Bodum models, but there don't seem to be any definitive answers. 

Some say it's fine to use directly on the hob, others say to buy a heat diffuser plate to ensure it heats the lower pot evenly, others say the pot will explode!

820,Coffee," Good afternoon everyone,

After I was no longer satisfied with the Nespresso coffee, I decided to search for a piston machine with a grinder. Since I am just new into this world, I don't want to spend too much money at this moment. Therefore I have decided to go for the Sage the Bambino plus as a machine.

I decided to go for the Eureka Mignon Specialita as a grinder. At first I wanted to buy a Sage grinder(because it was cheaper), but I understand now that a Eureka grinder is considerably better. Since I didn't want to spend too much money, I searched for this grinder on marketplace(from the Netherlands). Yesterday I came across the following ad:

[https://www.marktplaats.nl/v/witgoed-en-apparatuur/koffiezetapparaten/m1838051972-eureka-mignon-specialita-bonenmaler-chroom](https://www.marktplaats.nl/v/witgoed-en-apparatuur/koffiezetapparaten/m1838051972-eureka-mignon-specialita-bonenmaler-chroom)

The person concerned sells the grinder for 350 euros and indicates that he has been using it for 6 months (he bought it at Koffiewarenhuis.nl). Yesterday I bid 330 euros and he accepted it immediately. I can pick up the grinder tomorrow. I was wondering, before I finally buy it, if this is a good buy? I don't know anything about grinders yet, so I find it difficult to pass judgment on this. Tomorrow I can inspect the grinder before buying it, but I wouldn't know where to look at either. What strikes me is that the sticker which says specialita looks strange. It looks like it is about to fall off or that it has just been glued on. On new devices, but even on older devices, the stickers look much nicer and neater. Or am I totally wrong?

Im kinda stuck. 
When i started out with Specialty Coffee - everything that came to my mind was espresso, cappuccino, long black and flat white. Which is why i got myself an Espresso Machine - the rest is history.
But I've really come to enjoy filter coffee in the last few months and that's where my problem starts!

Since Im currently using a DF64 as my dedicated espresso grinder (which i love btw) and noticing that it produces a lot of fines for the V60, which results in a muddier cup - I thought about buying a grinder solely for pour-over and especially V60!
My first choice would be something like a Fellow Ode with SSP MP Burrs - but that would be around 600‚Ç¨ here in Germany and that's kinda overkill, for my budget.

So my question(s) is/are: Do you think, that maybe something like a Commandante would suffice? Does it produce a better V60 Cup than a DF64? Or is a regular Fellow Ode V1.1 (even without SSP Burrs) ""better"" than a Commandante? For that matter, what actually is the Ode V1.1 Version and does it finally grind fine enough?

&amp;#x200B;

I use a coarser grind closer to French Press, and 20g to 300g water.

&amp;#x200B;

I started out with the Tetsu 4:6 method, meaning the first two pours are with the switch open, and equal to 120g water. 60g, 60g to have balanced sweetness and acidity; slightly less (50g) first pour and more second pour (70g) for a sweeter brew; and finally slightly more (70g) first pour and slightly less (50g) second pour for a slightly more acidic brew.

&amp;#x200B;

Next I would close the switch and fill the remaining 180g of water and stir quite quickly with the end of a chopstick in a clockwise for about 45sec to fully saturate all the grinds in the water like a french press, after 45sec I press the switch and continue stirring in clockwise direction.

Will it make dialing in my espresso a lot harder if I'm constantly switching between super coarse and super fine between coffee types?

I drink three Nespresso coffee pods at the moment - espresso size. On the weekends, I occasionally do a V60 pourover with beans from a local cafe, for about 150-200 ml coffee ( I have them grind the beans for me at the moment).

Where I am:

- Nespresso pods are ~USD0.6 to USD0.8 a pod.
- A 200-225g of coffee beans is about USD9 to USD16 a bag.
- I am the only coffee drinker at home - so unsure whether I can use a bag of beans before they ""expire"".
- I am usually in a rush in the morning, so time efficiency is important during the week (I also keep a Nespresso machine at work for the afternoon pick me up).

I am interested in buying a beans grinder and making more espressos that way, learning more about coffee etc. However I am unsure whether it will just end up being a waste of money, given time cost / financial cost / coffee expiring before I finish it - and whether I am just thinking about this because I'm bored with Nespresso at the moment...

I'm looking to buy a new  grinder, I don't have much of experience in that regard as I only owned an encore before, and I mainly drink espresso daily but maybe twice a week a v60 or a french press. 

Originally I intended on buying a niche zero as I think it is perfect for me with it's low retention, grind quality and the overall aesthetics. However shipping it to Germany where I live will cause a price overhead, I think it would cost around 700 to 750 euro (shipping, customs...etc) instead of the original price based on some forums and that makes me wonder is it still worth it at this price point.  
As an alternative I'm looking into these two possible scenarios:

1. A premium hand grinder for both styles like the Kinu m47 (but not sure which variant to get though) or 1Zpresso (I don't know why they have soo many variants and also don't know which to pick.) or maybe Helor 101...etc

I decided to stop using my nespresso machine, but I struggle to find what I want to buy. I'll work from home, and on most days I think I drink three coffees, like one lungo coffee in the morning, one capuccino after lunch and a macchiatto in the afternoon. I also drink some shorter espresssos sometimes, but actually I mostly take them in restaurants, or after a dinner with friends. I drink my coffee with some sugar and a bit of milk usually.

&amp;#x200B;

I've a very basic semi-automatic delonghi machine in my other house, where I enjoy drinking some good specialty coffee. My budget is about 800 to 1000$ ideally (I'm in switzerland, so it's roughtly the same in chf).

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that having access to two different beans would be a good solution, so I could have like a specialty coffee for the espressos and lungos, and another (probably cheaper) coffee for the capuccino's and machiatto's, where using very high end coffee on a daily basis would probably be a waste. But unfortunately it seems it's pretty rare to have that feature. From what I saw with this, I found:

\- Mostly the Melitta T Smart or TS, which are pretty similar. I think I found the TS for roughly the same price so would go for this. My issue with this is that as the coffee goes through the same grinder, there would be some leftovers, and if I alternate espresso and a capuccino from both bean selectors, I'll always have a mix of them. And if I need to make a ""empty coffee"" between each, I'll lose so much that it's not worth it, and lose much time

\- Siemens Eq.9 S 700. Looks perfect, but much more expensive. Found a good second hand one but it was sold when I asked again about it. And not sure I really want to spend 1k on a machine with no warranty...

Jura giga 6 , Delonghie maestosa are out of budget.

I could also simply lose that feature, and go for any good machine (delonghi primadonna or dynamica plus seem good, etc) that also take ground coffee and use that for the machiattos, but it looks a bit like a waste.

Having the freedoms to buy from any roaster we chose doesn‚Äôt seem to be an option with the vendors, as I‚Äôm assuming they make some of their money on the coffee itself. I‚Äôm nervous about investing in a machine without the backing of someone that will fix it if it breaks.

I have recently started drinking coffee both hot and iced, and i really like it. I usually drink some iced coffee bought in a local grocery store or buy some in Starbucks.

Machine: Russell Hobbs Luna Filter Coffee Maker

Coffee: Lavazza Rossa Grounds (I don't have a bean grinder)

I've been trying to play around with the 1:16 ratio, so for example the last cup i made was 240ml (about 8oz) and i used 16 grams of grounds and it seems almost bitter? Same result when using 14-16g coffee grounds, which were grounded recently and only opened 2 days ago.

The instructions on my machine advise that ""the reservoir is calibrated to give 12 large cups (at 125ml per cup), and for each large cup, add 6g of ground filter coffee..
I tried this and it was quite weak so i can't seem to find the middle ground..

1000,Coffee,"I have access to an older DeLonghi Ecam machine and wanted to see if I can manage to brew coffee that I like. For taste comparison I brewed the same coffee in an AeroPress and as pour-over to my liking. All good.

The machine's version was more acidic and lacked flavor. Temperature was already at its maximum setting, so I adjusted grind size to as fine as the machine could handle without stalling and obvious channeling. The result was more flavorful and had less pronounced acidity. While it was still far away from the AeroPress and pour-over, the taste was much improved. Definitely the right direction.

I wondered how much coffee the machine used. Maybe it used less and this caused the weakness. Again, for comparison I made an AeroPress with 60g/L (1:17 ratio). I measured both how much coffee I got out and weighed the completely dried puck.

On to the machine. I made a coffee (not ""espresso"") with its ""normal strength"" setting, measured the output, dried the puck (yes, I emptied the container before) and weighed the completely dried puck. I then calculated g/L, or the ratio, for both brews.

Result: The machine used about 2.5 times as much coffee. Roughly 150g/L or about a 1:7 ratio for ""coffee"".

* Is this normal or is the machine defective?
* Is the machine's design only capable to extract such a tiny fraction of the flavor compared to other brewing methods due to temperature, grind size, contact time, etc.?
* Any idea how I could have invalidated my little experiment?

1067,Coffee,"TL, DR at the bottom.

We have a best-for-budget auto dripper at home, which uses paper filters. I'm not against it, since it's extremely easy to use. Otherwise, my sister probably wouldn't brew her coffee. And I also benefited from it for years. Especially for straining cold brew coffee...

But it's filtering the coffee too much. I guess those extremely fine grounds that only paper filter can strain gives a taste I prefer.

The machine also somehow has moods and it never brews the same coffee twice, I think, but that's a different story ü§£

Thanks to James Hoffman, I learned about cupping, after benefiting from his french press video. I don't usually test coffee, but after trying test comparison between a few cups, I noticed that the cups had actually drinkable coffee. There was a large sediment at the bottom, of course, but if I just drink the liquid layer, it was actually a normal and enjoyable coffee.

Recently, I started to brew only with this. It's extremely easy, almost as easy as instant coffee. And it tastes significantly better than the paper filter, for my taste. And no additional dishes to wash, unlike french press with a difficult to clean fine mesh.

I also liked to brew with Turkish coffee method before. It was similar, meaning no straining. But decanting(pouring very slowly) the coffee with the Turkish coffee pot(jazwa) gave unexpectedly clean cups. Even better than french press sometimes.

So I'm now mixing this with cupping. I have a glass tea brewing pot with a large bottom. So it's very suitable for decanting.

https://i.imgur.com/iCqrdHs.jpeg

I pour the coffee into the cup, after mixing it slowly at 4 mins. I don't want to disturb fine grounds that would settle later, so I let them settle in the cup, instead of the pot. They are not too much, so this doesn't concern me.

I sometimes use a coarse strainer during pouring, just to catch the floating coarse grounds and chaffs. But it's not necessary.

The cups are significantly cleaner than cupping alone. And even though I dirtied one additional dish, the glass pot is very easy to clean. I'm really enjoying this method now.

TL, DR: I like the things in the coffee that the paper filters strain. I also like simpler methods(thus, ""the best part is no part""). So I started brewing with cupping and it was what I was looking for. Then I started brewing in a large bottom tea pot (the image/link above) and slowly pouring into the cup, and this simple addition gave significantly cleaner cups, while still being simple. So I'm really enjoying this method above other methods.

Ps: I made an electric screwdriver adapter for my Porlex grinder ü§£ I don't know if it will heat the grounds too much, but it's being fine for one cup grinding.

Note that I made a lower quality adapter years ago but the tolerances were too bad and it didn't last long. So I used Torx head and tight tolerances this time, and it's going well. The screw bit was a bit rusty, so I did hot bluing and cooled it in leftover sunflower oil, that I was using for season coating pans. So it probably also has a thin polymer coating. I think it will be rust free now.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I had to work late at night. Basically, I had to do it for a couple of nights. I had no other options except to take some work home and finish all the reports at night after dinner when everyone was asleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I find working at nocturnal hours very satisfying -- you are on your own, no one bothers you, and you can focus on work without getting distracted by any other problems, text messages, and phone calls. You are just on your own with your thoughts and your work. Sometimes, I look in the window or go on the terrace at my house for a small break. Before that, I brew a delightful coffee. Recently, I've got a coffee press. I didn't want to wake everyone around with our noisy espresso machine. It also makes a good coffee, but the noise wakes everyone before the delightful scent reaches them.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm trying to master the skill of making a delightful coffee in a French press. I'm doing pretty well so far. I even noticed that coffee prepared in a French press is more aromatic than an espresso machine coffee. Maybe the technique plays a key role in the brewing process, or our espresso machine is a bit outdated. Who knows, but this aroma used to wake my family at night. Still, I try to be quiet and careful because I like to watch the starry sky and enjoy my drink.

&amp;#x200B;

But, this coin has another side. I struggle to fall asleep when I'm done with the work with all this caffeine. Then I struggle to wake up at night. Everything is twisted for me right now, and I feel lost when it is day and time to go to sleep. I know that the best solution is to consume less caffeine.

I own a small coffee company in the Bay Area of California. We currently sell coffee bags but are looking to expand into a mobile cart. We would like to build a utility cart into a setup that sells ready to drink drip coffee and cold brew, accompanied with oat and almond milk in a Zojirushi pot, with extra plant-based milk in a cooler full of ice. We don't want to bring any dairy because of the risk of it spoiling and not having the necessary permits. Dairy is more of a liability than anything for our setup. 

As far as preparing the coffee goes, we would like to use commercial perculators to prepare large amounts of drip coffee that we will fill into a 5 gallon cambro. Cold brew would be prepared in a large Toddy cold brew bucket, and we would fill it into another 5 gallon cambro. Oat milk and almond milk would be setup ready to pour in a Zojirushi pot, and syrups, sugars, napkins, stirrers will be ready to go in case someone wants them. 

I know I need to obtain a seller's permit, health permit, and vehicle permit for my cart. My biggest question is can I get away with brewing the coffee in my own kitchen? People often use commercial kitchens when it comes to preparing food but coffee is something that can be so simply made your own house. 

Also, if I build my cart using a utility cart and simply sell ready to pour coffee, will I need a handwashing sink?

Have always drank filter coffee and trying a moka pot for the first time, but 30g of coffee and about 300ml of water are producing barely enough coffee for two people to share out of my 6-cup moka pot. It was a 'like new' unit from Amazon but seems literally spotless.

I'm following the guide produced by James Hoffman, so I'm following his process, stopping the brew at the first signs of sputtering:

.I'm filling the basket of My 6-cup moka pot with freshly ground coffee (not too fine) and topping it off without packing it down. 
.I'm filling the boiler with boiling water to just below the valve, assembling the pot and sticking it on a low-medium gas heat. 
.I'm watching the pot, and as it begins to produce a steady stream of coffee I turn the heat to low. 
.When it begins to sputter, I remove from heat and run the unit under cold water until sputtering stops.

The pot is way less than half filled with coffee at this point, and splitting it between two normal coffee mugs (from the UK for reference) produces what I'd describe as two puddles of coffee. With milk, it makes two half-mugs of strong, tasty coffee. When cleaning the unit, it seems like half the water is still in the boiler, and murky brown.

What is going wrong here? If this was a two pot machine I'd say happy days, but the idea of spreading this amount of coffee across six servings is... Well, it can't be possible, unless Italian coffee is traditionally served via Petrie dish. Am I some kind of cultureless moron serving out two triple strength coffees? Are Italian cups a lot smaller than I think they are?

Or am I doing something stupid that is causing the pot to spurt way earlier than it should? I inspect the grounds afterwards and there is no sign of channeling and all the grounds are moist. I checked the gasket too, it seems in good shape- the metal filter it is holding in place is loose enough to rotate but does not wobble.

I've tried the pot about eight times now trying not to vary my method, and have produced the same results every time so far.

Chemex process basically goes as follows:

* Grind (60g/litre) on Fellow Ode, setting one notch up from 4.
* Boil water in gooseneck kettle (water is soft, and run through under-sink Glacier Bay single stage filter, though I've tried distilled + Third Wave to the same effect)
* Rinse bleached paper Chemex filter, pour out water
* Add grinds, bloom ~1 minute
* Follow Chemex process from Stumptown

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a filter coffee machine with which I have this issue: I fill the filter about half full and the water tank full, start brewing coffee, and soon the inflow of water to the filter is greater than what passes the filter, causing the water to overflow the filter and the ground coffee spills over to the cup holding the filter, and often the ground coffee spills over to the brewed coffee too. [Here's couple of pictures](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hl1eg5mphldfolc/AABraX2o2c3MhzmOdkcXC-YRa?dl=0) of how it looks like afterwards.

The way I see it I either need to reduce the inflow of water, or increase the time water uses to pass the filter. The latter is likely the place to start. 

The flow of water through the filter is heavily redeced by the filter, to a - I believe - much greater extent than my previous filter coffee machines, so it seem like there's something about the design of the cup holding the filter causing the water to pass through very slowly.

**Review**

After researching the big bois like the Rancilio &amp; Gaggia Classic, gotta say it feels amazing not to spend that much money on those. PID and instant startup were the big features that got me not to buy those two. The moment people started talking about ""temperature surfing"" I was out, all I care about is a pretty nice cup of coffee with milk and a little sugar, iced or hot. 

Took like 9 failed batches with the Breville Smart Grinder but I finally got it dialed in. The espresso tastes great! I don't drink it straight, either Americano or Latte. I tried to take that plastic part of the portafilter off but I just couldn't, but the coffee tastes fine and no weird plastic taste. I was thinking of getting those expensive tamp/distributors, but honestly that cheap-ass plastic tamp that comes with it works just fine. 

The steam wand is loud AF, sounds like hellspawn being fried alive by the sun and screaming for mercy. I can't tell if it's just my bad technique or I'll have to deal with that every time I froth milk, but it seriously hurts my ears. My dog hates it lol. 

Honestly from a convenience standpoint, this thing is amazing and I don't see myself upgrading for years. The fact that I can roll out of bed and make an espresso within the next 5 mins is insane. I know r/espresso probably hates me but to those who are stressing out over your next machine or grinder, looking at the $400-800+ minimums for each that redditors claim you have to spend, this $300 machine has me perfectly satisfied as someone who just likes 'good' coffee and doesn't need 'best in class' at home.

(Tldr : do you know a way to remove rust on burrs without making them less sharp or bringing bad taste to the coffee grinded? And do you have any ideas about oils I could use to varnish the wood that doesn't go rancid or have a taste? Linseed oil seems applicable because it doesn't go rancid but is bitter so idk what to use.)


I recently acquired an antique Peugeot coffee grinder at a flea market. It is in quite good condition for the price (20‚Ç¨) so I wanted to try to restore it. 

There is rust on the handle that I removed by sanding but I don't know how to properly clean the burrs. As there is some rust around the burrs but not on the parts that actually grind the beans, I was tempted to soak it in vinegar and salt (to remove rust according to some web articles). However I also read that putting any liquid on the burrs would decrease their efficiency and was generally bad. Any suggestions? 

My other issue is dealing with the wood. It's quite old but in good condition, though coffee has been sitting there for a long time. That's why I wanted to try to sand it a bit with fine grit and then varnish it with something. The issue is that either the products are not food safe, either it can be done using oils that get rancid over time or that bring a bad taste. I thought of using linseed oil but it seems to be bitter at taste so idk if this will have any consequences on the end cup.

# Example 1:
So if my room temperature is 12 degrees and I want to get water at 70 degrees, I'll use a factor of 0.66. That means to get 1L of water at 70 degrees, I'll boil 0.66L of water and mix it with 0.34L of water at room temperature.

If I need 500g of water at 85 degrees and my room temperature is 22 degrees, I'll need 0.81*500g ~ 400g of boiling water and 100g of water at room temperature.

I'm a bit type A, so I have a spreadsheet tracking the input, pre-infusion time, brew time, yield, result. I have not pulled one great shot yet. For comparison, I can pull a perfectly fine shot on my friend's commercial-grade machine grinding the beans fresh in his billion dollar professional-grade grinder.

*Sigh*

1293,Coffee," I posted this exact same thing in r/nespresso and got suggestions to come here since I'm not stuck on the machine being a Nespresso

Here's my deal. I know nothing about specialty coffee except that I do love espresso and mainly want to make my own mochas without going out to coffee shops. It's just me at home so I don't need anything really fancy. I am looking at the Nespresso machines because I'm hearing that they create the best flavor. I have a budget of about $140 for a machine &amp; an additional $30-40 for a protection plan. My questions about choosing a machine:

1. Is my budget too low? I am looking at going through Amazon (which I know some people hate) because I have Prime and always get good customer service with them in case of problems.
2. What is the ""original"" machine(s)? I was told the pods are the best and cheapest. I don't know if I can make mochas with this one though. I'd like to make mochas most of all.
3. Is Nespresso the best choice for me? I'd like the convenience of pods but being able to also use my own coffee would be more budget-friendly.
4. I have looked at other machines but don't know if they are worth it. What about machines like the Chef Wave and other espresso makers?
5. Are there universal/reusable pods for the Nespresso or the other ""good"" machines?
6. I'm looking at making 1 mocha a day (occasionally 2). I expect to spend about $35 for coffee pods (if I can't use my own grounds).
7. I have a milk frother already.

So, basically, I want a machine that makes good coffee without it being a complicated process. I want something very simple to use and not too hard on the wallet for buying the coffee.

1294,Coffee,"I worked as a backup to our lead at a licensed Starbucks store for 12 years, with a 13th as just a barista.   During this time, which began when I was 27, I started with mochas...I enjoyed the dark chocolate flavor and how it mixed with the bitter espresso.   Like many of us, I eventually graduated to Americanos (they're cheaper), then black coffee, then straight espresso shots.   The work environment was extremely stressful, fast-paced, and busy, and we usually earned about $15k-$18k/wk at our peak with a skeleton crew of never more than 6 baristas, total, on the schedule (including the lead).   If we had to work 6 days a week to keep it open, that was just tough. 

During this time, I realized as I got older, I couldn't keep up with the pace.   So I did what we all do, got my Xanax prescription increased, and started pounding more and more shots so I could keep up.   My boss was not understanding of anything less than excellence, and I was convinced she deserved it.   It was unacceptable and *weak* to not be 100% ""on"" in the workplace.   My doctor started to advise me that my anxiety, heart rate, and bowel movements were all being negatively impacted, but I brushed it off.   This was *caffeine"" we're talking about...its not a serious drug.

About 5 years in, I developed interstitial cystitis.   It took me 2 years to get a diagnosis.    Caffeine is a horrible trigger for this condition, but I gave up orange juice and other trigger foods and decided I'd double down on coffee.   I can't do my job if I don't drink coffee after all.    And it was *unprofessional* not to be a coffee drinker and work at Starbucks.   

After about 8 or 9 years, my anxiety began to seriously increase in intensity.   Angry outbursts happened with customers, co-workers, anyone who I could lash out at, because my resting heart rate was now well above 100.   But I'd done this so long, I don't know how to do any other job.   Starbucks is the way.   So I just decided ""no cold brew,"" and kept on.

11 years in, I was hospitalized.   The ER doctor said I had ""caffeine intoxication.""   ""A toxic amount of caffeine is in your blood.    Have you been consuming more than 250mg a day?""   I laughed.   ""It's *easily* upwards of 500.""   He grimaced, but I laughed it off.   I'd just taper it down, do half-caff.   I wasn't addicted I could quit whenever I want.   Meanwhile, I developed nasty case of IBS.

At year 12, I had a mental breakdown.   Starbucks consumed my every waking thought, and I knew if I left leadership there it would soon fall apart.   But I finally got the courage to tell my boss I couldn't handle the pressure anymore.   It was my anxiety, you see.  My coffee intake continued.    A year later, I asked for a transfer out of Starbucks.   Now, I'll quit, I said.

I didn't for at least 2 years.   I developed nasty acid reflux, which I'm medicated for morning and night.

It's now 5 days ago.   I didn't have a bowel movement for over 48 hours.     The doctor said ""you have done significant damage over time to your bowel system with your coffee intake, and if you don't quit caffeine, it won't get better.""   He prescribed me several fine products that I'm now using, and I made the decision there:   the only way for me to break the addiction to coffee...was to go cold turkey.

I was hoping I'll get better results with some better beans and I got a new bag of quality beans and I couldn't tell absolutely no difference, still very sour borderline undrinkable coffee.

I tried 55-&gt;85 g range of extracted coffee but don't really notice a big difference. Maybe the taste gets a tiny bit blander and very tiny bit more bitter?

- Rocket Cinquantotto (~2,333 USD)
- ECM Technika V PID (~2,287 USD)

I recently started doing my research on getting my first espresso machine, but where I live, its kinda hard to find good prices for espresso machines. One or max 2 stores offer it, so it makes doing ""smart"" decisions lot harder. But then I stumbled upon this store ""Caffe Italia"". And they seemed to have great deal on the same machine I was looking to get, Gaggia Classic Pro. 

Quick browse around the internet, lead me to believe they might ship a machine atleast, if I paid with my credit card, the risk would be relatively low. I would just let my credit card company handle the plausible issues, and I would mod the gaggia anyways, so bad warranty was kinda expected. But while doing the order, I mistyped my card info, which resulted in order failing (transaction didn't go through) but order still processed? Idk what happened, its kinda buggy. But I left the customer support a message, on what happened.

It took them few days to respond, but they still did. In their email they just stated that ""just order it again"", and thats about it. The thing is, they responded 5 hours after their ""opening hours"", yeah, its probably out sourced, as everything is. But kinda shady in my opinion. Hard to imagine their support staff is working 10pm on a friday night, support hours listed on site is 10-16. Language was also pretty bad, probably worse than google translated, so probably 2 rounds of google translate? 

Then I went around and started looking around trust pilots. I don't know how I missed it on my initial sweep, but atleast entire finnish trustpilot site is botted, with obvious grammar mistakes on every review. Also almost like they are arguing the bad ones. 

Entire reason I'm typing this out now, is so people can find a post stating that this site is pretty shady. Everything on the internet seems to be just spammed with positive stuff, to hide the bad and honest stuff.

Search term ""Caffe Italia Reddit"", etc obvious experience thread tags are covered in non related posts. Can't prove they are trying to hide it, but wouldn't be out of ordinary for them it seems like... They also list their HQ to be in Finland/what ever portal of their site you look at.

From the beans, should I let the crust stay longer? Or break the crust sooner and let the coffee settle at the bottom? Does more coffee extract from the crust, or from settled coffee?

I just got a Hario Buono 1L kettle and was surprised to learn when I got it home that you can't actually boil 1L (or even 750ml, which is what I use for french press) of water in it: to reach the advertised 1L capacity, you have to fill the kettle up to the tippy-top, meaning that you can't even put the lid on without water overflowing the kettle. I tried to boil just 750ml of water in it and the lid popped off and the kettle boiled over before it even got to a rolling boil. So the 1L capacity, while technically accurate, is kind of useless when the kettle is actually used for its express purpose of boiling water.

Hario makes a 1.2L version but based on my experience with the 1L version, I'm not confident that the extra 20% capacity will prevent boil-over, and most other manufacturers of nice stainless kettles make versions right around 1L capacity.

A coffee that tasted strong, but too acidic or salty might be a high strength, low extraction brew. One that tasted weak and a little subdued or flat would be low strength, high extraction. All you would have to do is draw your graph axis and make a mark for how you thought the coffee tasted. The closer to your ideal balance, the better. 

It was inspired partly by some recent ƒÄrƒÅmse videos about coffee logging and their coffee recipe builder system, and also by a plugin I use in my recording software that uses two axis (axes?) to balance EQ. (I've linked a screencap.)

Honduran-native Mayra Orellana-Powell founded Catracha Coffee Company to link farmers in her home community of Santa Elena to specialty buyers. Over the course of a decade, it has helped an ever-expanding community of farmers to produce great coffee and gain economic security. With each year, Catracha‚Äôs coffee also seems to improve, becoming more expressive. Just take this deeply satisfying single origin: sweet like brown sugar or raw honey, it marries cocoa flavors with a stone fruit-like brightness, calling to mind the pure bliss of chocolate-covered cherries.

However, while I'd love to own a big-boy espresso machine and go nuts every morning making cortados and flat whites for my family while shouting about grind size and extraction rates at my neighbours, I am currently relying on a moka pot to get me as close to a tasty espresso type drink at home as I can without dropping major $$$.   

I've followed Hoffman's moka technique and I can get a consistently delicious strong brew, but without a proper steam wand, I am largely limited to an Aerolatte hand frother, which is actually pretty good at getting a decent microfoam in heated full-fat milk. Not perfect, since it requires a few iterations of froth/shake down stir/froth some more so that the few larger bubbles pop and the milk gets a bit more uniform, but the final result is totally acceptable.

One thing I've experimented with (and I was wondering if anyone has thoughts on) is adding evaporated milk in a 1:3 ratio to full fat milk before heating and frothing in order to get some more velvety thickness in the milk foam, along with a sweeter and richer taste. I'm guessing that the evaporation and heating process involved with evaporated milk does something chemically to the milk proteins that is similar to the effect steam has on the flavour of regular milk, but I honestly don't know what, other than that it's a definite improvement over just plain milk.

Looking at other brands, the [1Zpresso Q2](https://www.amazon.com.au/1Zpresso-AeroPress-Stainless-Numerical-Adjustable/dp/B083TGGHGL/) seems to cost at least $230 NZD; more than twice as much as the C2. The Comandante C40 comes in at $500 or [$400 on sale](https://www.espressoninja.co.nz/product/comandante-c40-mk3-hand-grinder-black/), which is sadly way out of my budget. 

Looking at some other brands: the [Hero manual grinder](https://www.amazon.com.au/Manual-Coffee-Grinder-Stainless-Conical/dp/B08X39ZJMB/) comes in at a reasonable $120 NZD and the [Normcore](https://www.amazon.com.au/Manual-Coffee-Grinder-Adjustable-Stainless/dp/B089P1MNW5/) comes in at $145. This one from Varia comes in at [$230](https://www.espressoninja.co.nz/product/varia-hand-grinder/).

This [random one](https://dipacci.co.nz/collections/hand-grinders/products/precision-hand-grinder?variant=40547356180651) comes in at $110.

1448,Coffee,"I've been a barista for close to about 8-years, working full-time during college and now freelance. Like many, I used to douse my coffee with milk and sugar. I drank the whole menu at Starbucks and couldn't imagine drinking something black. Instead, I needed it milky like the sun and would impress my barista friends at the number of pumps of sugar I used. I used to be the person that would put a quarter of drizzle in my Starbucks Caramel Macchiato. 

Now, being 28 years old, I don't drink coffee everyday, but when I do, I drink it black. It's taken me a long time to enjoy coffee this way, and I think anyone can learn to drink it black as well. It just takes small incremental changes, and a desire to change.

Where I started: I used to be the kid that put 10 pumps of classic, or sugar in my cup. Any drink, you name it. I needed a quarter-cup of cream, and at least 3-4 packets of sugar, Splenda, Equal etc. I couldn't imagine why anyone would want hot bean water. I saw coffee as a drink to energize. At the time, I was working at Starbucks, so I had the sugar and milk and cream to my disposal.

I eventually got a job in a third-wave coffee shop and anyone that knows coffee, now knows Starbucks is a terrible cup of coffee. It's good for a pinch and social status, for carrying that white-green mermaid cup, but if you want good coffee, you go to a third-wave coffeeshop and caf√©. I'm talking about Irving Farm, Blue Bottle, Hungry Ghost, etc. 

Sugar is by far the easiest thing to let go. Just reduce your intake by a quarter. You'll hardly notice and especially if you're pairing your cup of coffee to a pastry or meal, you definitely won't miss it. 

Cream just does magical things to coffee. It makes it turn milky-white, and silky-smooth on your tongue. And that's exactly why you need to remove it. Around this time, I started to drink black tea black, without milk or sugar. I got stuck on the cream, no-sugar phase for a while. 

I recently started to take a sip of my coffee before I would drop in cream. Like an ode to coffee, or a tribute, I would taste the first sip black, before I added cream. Stuck on this phase for a while. 

Eventually, I just got lazy. I would still take that first sip. Sometimes I would add cream. Other times, I'd get too busy and forget I had the coffee, but I would chug it down. Happened too many times to me.

Then one day, I just started to drink it black. I didn't enjoy it, but I would make a face after every sip. Like drinking a shot of alcohol, I would purge and gawk. 

If you ever drink coffee black, you know it's most bitter at it's highest temperature. So one day, I started to experiment. I'd let it cool to warm or room-temperature. That did the trick.

Today, I'm cream-free, sugar-free and loving it. Coffee is a ritual and part of my day, but I enjoy it black. I didn't think I could ever get here, from 10-pumps of sugar, to cream no-sugar, to now, black.

I have gotten back into coffee drinking, and also home roasting (right now Poppery with coffee from Sweet Maria's, though may get a Fresh Roast), and primarily use an old Zassenhaus to grind and use in an Aeropress with paper filter (use Hoffman's recipe).

My work place has an espresso machine. This is where I get my coffee. You select an option on the screen, it grinds the coffee and pours it. Options for chocolate, and what I can only assume is coffee creamer.

I've been gaining weight and can't figure out why when my diet has been stable. I realized this selection I'm using must be coffee creamer (I didn't know what it was before a few weeks ago).

1470,Coffee,"I've honestly not been a huge coffee person for most of my life, I typically prefer tea.  

My wife and I have a nespresso vertuo at home, which was really more of something my wife was using, but toward the beginning of the pandemic, I started drinking more coffee from the nespresso (mostly because it was really easy to order the pods, while getting anything else at the time was more difficult.)

One of the things I like about tea is the absolutely massive number of tea choices you can explore, as well as a lot of the ritual that can be involved in brewing a nice cup of tea.  The nespresso doesn't really offer that, so I started looking further into what's out there for coffee.

I started out with a V60 and a Krups electric burr grinder.  My wife had bought a french press in the past, and I also ended up buying an aeropress.

With the french press and aeropress I've been able to make pretty decent coffee, and sometimes can make a good cup of coffee with the V60, but it kind of seems hit or miss, sometimes ending up a bit sour or bitter, or both.  

I also keep getting this ""paper"" flavor.  At first I thought it was coming from the paper filters I'm using, but then I realized I was tasting it when I wasn't using a filter as well.

I just bought a 1zpresso jx pro (I spent a bunch of time debating between the various timemore and 1zpresso grinders, and eventually decided to go with this one,) which, to be fair, is 3x the cost of the krups, but the grind is so much more consistent.  

I honestly wasn't expecting there to be that big of a difference in the flavor, but my pour overs have just been really nice using the new grinder.  No sourness, just ever so slightly on the edge of becoming bitter, which I'm assuming if I dialed up one more click would go away, none of the ""paper"" flavor I was getting with the Krups.  The flavor of the coffee seems more rounded (not sure how to better describe it.) And the coffee actually seems to have a bit more body as well, it's a really nice mouthfeel.

The water is also running through the coffee much slower, which I was worried about at first, thinking I was going to end up over-extracting the coffee, but it really wasn't.

The biggest problem I'm having with the new grinder is that it takes almost a minute of manually turning the crank to get enough grounds for the pour over, which I guess I'll get used to.","Was using a cheap electric grinder, bought a slightly more expensive hand grinder, and damnit, the coffee from the hand grinder is actually better...",1650463058,True

1508,Coffee,"Hey :)
I've been really enjoying using the Clever Dripper recently due to its ease of use. I tend to get more interesting cups with my Aeropress or V60 though, so I think I need to work on my recipe/extraction.
I pretty much do what James Hoffmann recommends in his video. So: Water -&gt; Coffee -&gt; stir to wet all the grounds -&gt; 2mins -&gt; stir/shake to break the crust -&gt; 30sec -&gt; draw down.

To change the end result I can think of the following variables: ratio, water temperature, grind, steep time, agitation. 

I'm pretty happy with the strength of the coffee I get. I usually go for something like 65-70g per liter of water. 

As I use mostly light roasts I tend to brew with boiling water (or close to boiling, as there's some temperature loss due to starting with the water). With more medium roasts I drop it a couple of degrees. Steep time seems to only barely increase extraction in immersion or steep and release brews.
So what's left is grind and agitation. From what I can vaguely remember, with immersion brews, agitation has more significant of an effect than a finer/coarser grind. Because there's a percolation phase though, I would assume that the grind is more significant than in a French Press for example.

For some amount of time it was bearable, but when it started to get quite warm in the sun, all of a sudden, my pulse started going way up to the point where i even got dizzy so i had to sit down for a while, until i had calmed down a bit.

After this event, i now feel like i perceive the caffeine a lot stronger. I always felt it being strong, but i was able to drink a cup of coffee and not feel this bad. Although maybe I feel like the caffeine is stronger now because in my opinion, the effect that nicotine had on me was quite similar to caffeine to me. So maybe, because i associate this effect with feeling bad, it causes me to freak out slightly.

After a few weeks of owning the EC680 I got a bit frustrated with it, and gave up on measuring anything related to espresso. I have vials with 18g of coffee and that's about it. I've been grinding with different settings, tamping with difference forces in an attempt to finally hit that ""spot"".

Today was that day, 18g in, distributed, tamped, added paper filters above and below the coffee bed, inserted into my machine, pressed go and realized that I was a bit too thin, it took a WHILE to get everything out (should be programmed to pull 50g of liquid).

Since I was getting some sour espressos before (since I upped my dose from 16g to 18g) I was okay with it since it looked pretty uniform. After 35~50 seconds it finished, I decided to taste it, since the smell was clean, I didn't feel that ""sour"" smell.

I swirled with a tiny spool I have and tasted all the crema that remained at the spool and HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT. it tasted fucking amazing, almost no bitterness, nice finish, and a super strong caramel/nuts flavor.

Second spoon was almost the same thing, and after that it all went downhill, turning bitter and bitter by the second.

I have no idea if it's possible to get the entire shot to taste like that, but that is something I really wanna try now. Glad I bought a new scale a few days ago, now I just have to wait and try everything again.

But I'm inspired by the breadth of knowledge that's necessary to be certified.

So with one eye on this [useful course summary I found](https://www.coffeestrategies.com/q-grader/q-grader-course/), and tweaking substantially for my interests, here's my proposed at-home syllabus:

**General coffee knowledge**
* Read a well-regarded book about each of: cultivation / harvesting, processing, cupping, roasting and brewing.
* Solid understanding of the impact of bean origin.
* Solid understanding of the coffee supply chain and cost / pricing mechanisms (I'm an econ nerd), including both commodity grade and specialty coffee.
* Put James Hoffmann's *The World Atlas of Coffee* on my bookshelf so people know I mean business.

**Roasting**
* Buy a roaster, burn a bunch of beans, then stop burning them and actually start roasting well.
* Solid understanding of and ability to identify roasting defects.
* Ability to roast various origins and varietals to the correct roast levels. 

**Cupping / Tasting**
* Comprehensive understanding of the various cupping protocols.
* Solid understanding of the impact on water on cupping, and the ability to identify where water is causing issues.
* Ability to identify different intensities of sweet, salty and sour solutions (inspiration from [here](https://www.coffeestrategies.com/q-grader/sensory-skills-exam/))
* Familiarity with the Le Nuz Du Cafe scents (or equivalent).
* Comfortable in scoring a coffee using the SCAA Coffee Cupping Form (acknowledging the subjectivity in this, and fact you'd never get close to professional level)

**Brewing** 
* Comprehensive understanding of making espresso, e.g. the impact of grind, ratio, distribution, temperature, pre-infusion, flow rate, pressure, dialing in, diagnosing poor technique.
* Solid understanding of two other brew methods (for me, Aeropress and v60). Able to experiment with different techniques and identify differences which result.

*Note: nothing in the above addresses green coffee grading - doesn't seem relevant enough for me as a home hobbyist.

This is my first post on this sub. After a year and a half of drinking Nespresso, I decided I wanted to try the Bialetti Moka Express. I had a few questions about this.

First, the directions mention using cold/room temperature water. But I've also read elsewhere that I should use hot water, because it cuts down on the brewing time, &amp; it prevents the coffee from tasting metallic. Is this true?

Second, what do you recommend the heat setting/length of time? When will I know when to turn it off and when the coffee is ready?

Third, should I use a cold towel/put the moka pot under cold running water to cool it after?

Fourth, I read on another website the following:

""Does The Moka Pot Make Espresso?

I know that moka pots are often referred to as ‚Äústovetop espresso makers‚Äù, but sadly, that description is a little... optimistic.

You see, espresso is made when hot water is forced through super fine coffee grounds at 8-10 bars of pressure. The moka pot is only capable of producing 1-2 bars.

It‚Äôs just not enough to really be called true espresso, though the result is definitely espresso-like.

The coffee is still intense, still heavy-bodied, and still good for making faux-espresso drinks like cappuccinos and americanos. But if you want to be able to make true espresso, you‚Äôll need an actual espresso machine.""

**Grinder:** Wilfa CGWS-130b. **Espresso machine:** Delonghi Dedica EC685.

**Modifications:** Rancilio Silvia V1 steam wand (one hole) + Bottomless portafilter (nonpressurized)

(I also have a water filter jug, a distributor and a steel tamper.)

I am looking into the Rancilio Silvia E V6 (machine) + Rocky (grinder) combination, because I want to make richer espressos and smoother milk, of course. 

I am mostly curious about the espresso with this upgrade. I *know* the milk steaming will be so much better with three holes at the Silvia steam tip, so there's no question about the value there.   
(I have a good amount of experience (6 months) with a La Marzocco Linea PB (Rather spoiled at work), which has four holes at the steam tip). 

However, let's pretend that the only upgrade I got was getting an *actual* espresso grinder e.g. getting a Rancilio Rocky (the Wilfa model at best only does moka pot fineness, and besides it's not even a stepless grinder). **Would such an upgrade ""suffice"" as far as getting richer espresso is concerned?** I suppose what I am really asking is ""how big"" an upgrade would *that* be value-wise compared to *also* getting a ""better"" espresso machine? 

This leads me to another question: **Assuming I know exactly what I am doing; and that I am using an espresso grinder; and that I am using all equipment to its fullest potential, then** ***what would I be able to accomplish*** **with a Silvia** ***which I could never accomplish*** **with a modded Dedica?

I have a Niche Zero and love it. I use it mainly for espresso. Recently, I have also started to drink pour over (I use a V60). So, I switch between grind sizes on the Niche (\~40 for pour over, \~20 for espresso).

Now, I have read that Comandante C40 is an excellent pour over grinder, and I am thinking of getting one. However, my question is whether the C40 is indeed that much better than the Niche to warrant getting it. In other words, how much better should I expect the C40 to be? Is it worth investing in the C40?

I just purchased an open box Profitec Pro 300 and I have been having issues with the device tripping my GFCI. Here's a scenario I experienced:

Turned machine on
Waited ~10 minutes
PID read 93C (which was the configured temperature)
Turned on the brew switch, 
Brewed for 23 seconds
Hit the brew switch to off
GFCI tripped

I then tried again three separate times and it functioned properly, waiting each time for the PID to read 93.

The fifth time, I did not wait until the PID read 93, but instead was in the high 60s, hit the switch on, after a few seconds, hit the switch off and the GFCI tripped.

I have had occasions where I'd purge the machine after cleaning the portafilter and it would trip the GFCI.

1685,Coffee,"After using Third Wave Water for about two years, and often diluted around 50% the last year, I decided to try do-it-yourself water. My first attempt seemed okay and it is a different taste in the coffee, but I want to learn how the different minerals affect taste.

My first attempt targeted       40 ppm kh alkalinity with baking soda, 70 total permanent hardness equally magnesium and caclium via epsom salt heptahydrate and calcium chloride anyhdrous (note, the minerals were not equal in measurement but equal in the end result of hardness they would add which took almost twice as much magnesium heptahydrate since it has more water molecules in it than anhydrous calcium chloride.) 

From what I can gather based on the measurements of ingredients in TWW its profile is: 40 to 50 ppm alkalinity kh and 135 to 160 total hardness about 88% magnesium 12% calcium.  So diluted 50% would be 20 to 25 alkalinity and 70 to 80 hardness.  

I tried two coffees and compared to same brew parameters they were more airy and clean than the same with 50% diluted TWW.  Their sweetness was more background and lighter.  The TWW brewed coffee had more direct sweetness.  I liked aspects of both.   


From what I have read magnesium brings out sweetness where calcium brings out creamy texture.  I could see how the smooth, airness I got in the 50/50 magnesium calcium might have come from calcium.  Perhaps the lack of direct sweetness was from the higher alkalinity?  I noticed when I use TWW 100% it is often creamier, maybe from 40 to 50 alkalinity toning down acidity, but still more sweet from the higher magnesium.

the problem is, the spring loader fully opens and the water just falls through instantly. there's no brewing over time. it just delivers dirty water a few seconds after you pour it in. that's it.

the only way to get anything decent out of it was  to remove the tank and lean it in a pot so the water has a chance to do its magic. I did this overnight and then re mounted the tank on the carafe. coffee rushed through and that was that.

something is clearly amiss. but it doesn't seem broken. it just seems terribly designed. but this thing gets good reviews. maybe I'm wrong and  the spring loaded deal is effed?

1752,Coffee,"I had to suddenly relocate to another country, so wasn't able to take my Wilfa Svart but still wanted good coffee. I had a Rhino Hand Grinder from Rhinowear that I bought at the beginning of my journey into alternative brewing, but thought I wanted something better yet still small. Used a coupon I got as a gift and bought a Timemore Chestnut. 

Oh boy, they couldn't be more different. Yes, technically Timemore is 2x the price, but I think it's wort paying to anyone who can afford it at all. 

The advantages I notice:

* It's so much faster. I can grind my dose in 20-30 seconds. It takes up to 2m with a Rhino. 
* The setting mechanism actually locks on to something. With Rhino I couldn't reliably fix it in a certain position when trying to get a coarse grind. 

I'm not sure if it's common for all cheaper grinders, but I suppose it comes down to the steel vs ceramic burrs as well, as steel ones produce a more uniform grind (and obviously they do it faster).

Good hand grinders cost almost as much as a good entry-level electric grinder, but if you need to compromise on size or often get out with all your coffee gear, I think you should think twice about trying to save money on grinders.

1759,Coffee,"To be more specific, I mean to compare the flavour differences between each grinder due to different grind uniformity.

Recently I tried comparing the Hario Mini Slim Plus to the Timemore C2 via cupping. I expected a massive jump in clarity and sweetness from the C2, because most reviews say it's a great upgrade from a ceramic burr grinder.

To my surprise, I couldn't taste an obvious difference. I even had a hard time discerning one from another, and my guess was wrong when blind tasting.

Then I remembered that I often see percolation methods (such as a V60) being used in grinder comparisons, but I don't fully get why. It seems odd to me because percolation (specially with a V60) is quite sensitive to the brewing technique, which is hardly exactly repeatable and adds another variable that impacts flavour.

- She will be using store-bought grounds. She has owned a grinder in the past and seems steadfast on not owning a grinder again.
- She drinks two cappuccino-esque drinks a day, and has really low standards for the coffee itself. She set her current machine to put a double lungo through each pod and she is happy with the bilgewater that comes out
- She has her own milk frother and will happily continue to use it if no steam wand is available

1780,Coffee,"I decided to look at how different recipes affect extraction in order to understand how different variables interact with each other. I can then decide how to tweak recipes for the given coffee. I see how high extraction can go whilst still tasting good (but this is very grinder dependent). Much of what I say will apply to other brew methods as well.

Firstly, here are the constants:

* Hario Switch 03
* Hario 03 filter papers with the tab.
* Grinder is the Baratza Forte BG (steel 54mm ditting flat burrs)
* Almost always 15g coffee to 250g water (but nevertheless the same ratio with other doses)
* 100c water with hardness around 50ppm (Norway)
* VST refractometer is zeroed with brew water before every measurement

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the results:

* Grinding finer than you think you should will increase exraction to a point ( remember this is grinder dependent). Grinding too fine will not only make your drawdowns longer, but reduce extraction (this is common for both filter and espresso). I am grinding on the macro setting of 3 and up to the first half of 4 on the Forte. The coffee bed is muddy at the end. With multi-pour recipes with the brewer partially open (more on that below), you can grind coarser.
* Water first and coffee last results in a faster drawdown by 30-60 seconds. 
* Coffee first and water last results in a slightly higher extraction (about 0.05 TDS) This is likely due to a slightly higher slurry temperature by adding the water last. The resulting brew is a few degrees C hotter too.
* A larger brew recipe (for example 27g coffee to 450g water results in a higher exctraciton (also likely due to higher thermal mass) and vice versa. You won't need to adjust the grind by any significant amount here.
* There is no point using water less than 100C. The Switch gives a final brew of about 5 degrees C cooler than other pourover brewers. The slurry during steep was around 83C.
* Steep time for one-pour recipes is insignificant *after* 1 minute 30 seconds. Shorter than this and extraction is less. Over 3 minutes and extraction is so marginally higher it is not worth the wait (and the resulting brew is significantly cooler)
* Stir like crazy at the start of a brew to ensure everything is mixed evenly (precision in this step is not required for extraction. Just make sure everything is evenly wet.)
* Swirling and waiting 30 seconds before opening the brewer proved *very* significant in achieveing proper extraction. I preferred swirling at the end rather than stirring (although swirling is impossible if you brew the max 450g water). Without this step, TDS was only around 1.20.
* James Hoffman's recipe of water first, add coffee, stir, wait 2 minutes, stir, wait 15-30 seconds, open brewer gave consistent results of TDS between 1.35-1.45. I prefer to wait 30 seconds before opening the brewer.
* Want to brew with much higher extractions than 20-21% (1.35-1.45 TDS)? Sprometheus on youtube showed extractions well beyond this (22-24%). The key I have found is how often you pour onto a drained coffee bed. In his video, he pours 4 times and gets crazy high extraction.  However, I didn't like how long the brew took. I wanted to simplify this and did the following:
   * Coffee first with brewer open. Pour 50g water and stir like crazy to evenly wet coffee. Wait 1 minute (we want a completely drained coffee bed). Close the brewer. Pour entire rest of water and swirl a litle. At between 1.30 and 2.00, swirl again and wait 30 seconds before opening hte brewer.
      * Here I was getting TDS of 1.55-1.6. (22-23%) By changing my grind I can eventually adjust this to my liking.

So how did the coffee actually taste? In short. Amazing. Clean. Evenly extracted. By following these rules, it will be hard to go wrong. This is such a consistent and easy to use brewer that I can recommend it to anyone out there regardless of experience in coffee.",I got hold of a VST refractometer and did a deep analysis of Hario Switch recipes,1649954901,True

1823,Coffee,"As the title says, I think I finally got my Moka Pot action down guys, and I'm so happy. Sipping good tasting coffee at work, feels like it increased the quality of my life. It's truly amazing how we can find joy in such a small and seemingly insignificant things in our lives.

Before, the coffee that I made with my Moka Pot the results were inconsistent. I always used fresh roasted beans from local roasters--sometimes I'd get a good cup of coffee, other times, not. Often I get a cup of coffee that's too acidic or too bitter.

Asking around and doing some research (still learning), I learned that I needed to control the size of the grounds and the temperature at which I was boiling the water based on how old my beans were.

And let me know if I'm wrong, I'm still learning and completely open for any advices.  
But in short,   
Smaller ground size --&gt; slower rate of flow of water through the grounds --&gt; more extraction  
Bigger ground size --&gt;  faster rate of flow of water through the grounds --&gt; less extraction  
Higher temp of stove --&gt; faster rate of flow  --&gt; less extraction  
Lower temp of stove --&gt; slower rate of flow --&gt; more extraction  


And the level of extraction determines how bitter or acidic or how perfect the cup of coffee is

And so based on the freshness of the beans,  
FRESH beans --&gt; more gas --&gt; slows the rate of flow --&gt; bigger ground size  
older beans --&gt; less gas --&gt; faster rate of flow --&gt; smaller ground size  


and based on my taste and the freshness of the beans, I can adjust any factors above (but I usually keep the stove temp constant and adjust the ground size), and I'm getting more constant results of my coffee. And the grinder that I'm using--Baratza Encore--isn't a super high end one, but for now, I'm satisfied with it as I'm still relatively new to the coffee world. Definitely my goal to get a good espresso machine and grinder, but that's down the road in the future. I think my Baratza and Moka Pot will serve me well for a good few years of time.

1839,Coffee,"TL/DR - does anyone know if Alpro has changed their recipe for their regular (non Barista) oat milk to deliberately stop it foaming? 

Since moving to Japan in 2019, my options for oat milk were limited, untila couple of years ago Alpro became available and Minor Figures could be bought online. With MF costing double, I saved it for special occasions, especially as I mainly drink coffee without milk.

This is also why I haven't invested in a steamer, and foam using a Hario wand. However, despite most oat milk being difficult to foam, I was always able to get the Alpro to foam.

Recently, I was given a Nespresso milk foamer as a gift (I used to have something similar back in the UK, and it was very effective at foaming all milks) which prompted me to try making lattes again. However, the Alpro would not foam at all in the device, nor with my Hario wand. (I bought some more Alpro from a different just to be sure it wasn't a bad batch)

I bought some Minor Figures barista, which foams really really well in the machine, but I found the barista version to have a much stronger oat flavour than the regular Minor Figures.

This is where it gets strange though, I thought I would balance the Minor Figures by mixing in some Alpro, but the moment I add any Alpro to the minor figures (I'm talking, literally a splash, less than 5%) it stops the Minor Figures from foaming completely. It literally does not foam at all.

This has me thinking there must be something in the Alpro to stop it from foaming. Alpro has recently introduced a Barista version of their oat milk in Japan, so I'm wondering if they are adding something to the regular oat milk to stop it foaming in order to make their Barista version more compelling to people wanting to use it for coffee, as I see no other explanation why a tiny amount would completely stop minor figures from foaming (plus the fact Alpro used to foam)

The humble pen and paper. We should all have it and we should all know how to use it. After all, it's an essential part of our daily lives and hobbies, so why shouldn't it be a part of this hobby?

I've left a few comments on some threads about using a journal with their exploration of coffee, and since there was positive feedback and a pattern that showed not many people did this, I thought I'd bring up why I do it, how I do it, and how you can do it too.

And the best part about this enhancement to your brewing journey? It's CHEAP and one of the best upgrades you can make to your brewing kit that enhances consistency, thoughtfulness, and enjoyment. You'll really see a difference with this, give it a try and see how it impacts your ritual. What do you have to lose?

# What? Journal?

Mindfulness is next to godliness and thoughtfulness is next to happiness. We drink coffee to enjoy it and be happy. So we should think about it too. Simple, easy, perfect. Or at least it would be if we could remember how to replicate that perfect cup *every time*. However we forget, we mess up, and sometimes we want to try something different and experiment to try something new.

Notice that word in that last sentence? Experiment? Well, that's something funny about coffee. It's drinkable chemistry! If you're going to think back to your chemistry class, what did you always have with you in the lab? A lab journal. It was useful in making sure you could repeat your results and confirm that. Well, this Coffee Journal is exactly the same. We're going to record our experiments with our coffee and make it so we can repeat them as much as we want to.

# Why though?

We already think about our coffee a lot. We think about grind size, fine distribution, method of brew, and eventually taste. But what if we want to taste that cup again? Well with our ~~lab~~ coffee journal we can remember exactly how we made that cup, and we can remember how that cup tasted. It lets us dial, trial, and reproduce our experimental brews and enjoy a great cup of coffee again and again. We can even do some tasting notes or custom scoring.

# Cost to benefit ratio

Astronomical. If a grinder with 150 dollars has tons of steps and you try chasing a certain cup, how do you remember where you started? Easy, you wrote it down every step of the way and can go back to the one you liked or change it in an easy step forward.

It also lets you experiment with developing your palette in really fun and exciting ways after you're used to the coffee with pairings! Add some spices? write down your thoughts. Have it with ice cream? [Write that down](https://youtu.be/_tZckjQylGU?t=26). 

# An Example

Earlier I posted a picture of one I did real fast while having an evening cup of decaf with my desert. Because I have handwriting, it might be hard to read for some people, and so for them, I have transcribed it below. This was just one tasting I recorded in a new journal but the basics are all here. How I brewed it, how much I brewed, what method I used, and what I thought.

I didn't score it, but that's because I didn't want to. Next time if I want to score it? Just do it!

Date: 4-12-2022  
Roaster: Chocolatefish (local to Sacramento, CA)  
Bean: La Union Decaf

   * Roast
   * Fruit(no acid, non citris, pulp)
* Godiva Mini Peanut and Honey bar  
enhances:
   * Cocoa fat
   * Caramel (salted)
   * Fruit Acid(non-pulp, stone?)

Taste: Good, chocolate, fruit acid, caramel finish

Accurate to Roaster Tasting Notes :)

Now tomorrow I know what that coffee tastes like with that recipe and I can do it again

Or I could change it. Want some more acid to come out? Less heat or finer grinds(or both). Want some more roast to come out? Rougher grinds or hotter water. Want some different notes thrown in? Mix some other coffees in small ratios to modify the taste or add some spices. With this journal, I know how each of those cups tastes, and I can use it to taste it again or make it for some friends.

Maybe I should try some peanut butter in a dark roast cup. I wonder how that would taste? Well after I do that, I can certainly tell anyone else what happened thanks to this journal, and I can even use it to swap recipes! Probably get a sifter set though and communicate grind size in microns if you really want to do that.

Now it's your turn to take on this journey. Don't just do this for coffee though. Get a journal for each of your hobbies and have fun learning, experimenting, and enjoying everything you can think of and being able to do it again and again.

Now go drink and be jittery.

# Notes

The Hoffman Technique for v60 can be found on youtube, I'm sure a lot of you have seen it. [Here is a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo) in case you haven't.

Modified Hoffman Technique: I modified the ratios of water that you use. Bloom uses about 2x the grind weight in ml, so if you use 30g, you'll use 60ml and at that point, you've gotten more than 10% of 500ml, so followed by 50% of the grind you get a bit over the 60% he suggests you have poured by the time point. This just makes the math a bit easier since it's Bloom(B), Half(H), then whatever is left, and thus the Rest(R) of the grinds, hence why it is BHR.

Pairings are something you do with cheese, wine, booze, anything you can test, etc. so you can enhance or expose parts of the pallet and you can absolutely do that with coffee with whatever you want. Do a base cup, then pair a few things. You'd be surprised how quickly this really expands your pallet and language.

My water is straight almost perfect, so I just use Sacramento city water filtered with Brita and mixed back to the city water in a 2:1 ratio to bring down the chlorination a bit and get a pretty great extraction with a great range of TDS and PH.",Elevating your Coffee Experience with Pen and Paper,1649832585,True

When I contacted Bonavita and they replied quickly but unfortunately only to say that they don't support Bonavita machines sold prior to 2021 ([https://bonavita.life/pages/get-in-touch](https://bonavita.life/pages/get-in-touch) \- though on the bright side their new website is a lot better than the old one...).

After looking into it more, it seems that both the Bonavita and Brewista coffee maker brands are owned by (and always have been owned by) the same China based manufacturing company, Smartco. The two brands each had different US based distribution companies, but last year Smartco decided to go with new distributors for both brands. Legally the previous distribution companies owned any warranty claims, but since Smartco has always been the puppet master behind the scenes it feels slimy that they are refusing to continue to take care of machines that they themselves made. It also seems stupid from a business perspective to sully the image of a brand that they have always owned. ([https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/the-rise-fall-and-potential-resurrection-of-a-coffee-brewing-legend/](https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/the-rise-fall-and-potential-resurrection-of-a-coffee-brewing-legend/), [https://bonavita.life/pages/warranty](https://bonavita.life/pages/warranty) \- screenshot of this page below)

So while Smartco may not be doing anything illegal, if you buy any Bonavita or Brewista products you just have to hold your breath and hope they don't decide to change to a new distributor again and leave all their existing customers hanging. I know plenty of people have been using Bonavita brewers for years without problem but mine completely failed after 2 years, so...

1883,Coffee,"Hi everyone. I'm not sure if this post belongs here, but I had an immediate urge to write about this. Perhaps it's a cautionary tale. Some time ago I wanted to order Option-O Lagom Mini, but it was out of stock for many months. Then, some time ago suddenly it was back in, so I made the order. I especially ordered the Obsydian Burrs (48mm) to make espresso.

I just got my Option-O Lagom Mini package and was about to try it out, but I noticed something strange with the package - it was cut at the bottom. I had a bad feeling about this and opened the inside box. I noticed that the main body of the grinder was taken out of the white plastic packaging, while the cup and the power charger were still in their bags as they should be after leaving the factory. I also noticed that the white cover for the coffee input was broken. It seems like someone hastily opened the package somewhere on the way and did something with the main body, breaking the input cover along the way. Then I looked inside the main body and I noticed what happened. Someone switched the Obsydian Burrs (48mm) to the regular ones. 

I looked at the photos of both types of burrs which are on Option-O's homepage and I am now 100% sure that the burrs were replaced during transport. The DHL package it came in looked fine, and no one from the Post office in  Japan (where I live) would ever do such a thing, so it must have been done right before sending it by post. Either by a factory worker or someone who took the package to the post office to send it. 

I'm attaching photos to show you how it looks. Obviously, the first thing I did was to contact Option-O, and am now waiting for their answer. 

Please, everyone, check your packages. Especially products with optional settings, like the optional 48mm burrs for Option-O in my case, which are easy to swap could be objects of theft. If I get an answer from Option-O I will post an update.

&amp;#x200B;

I was severely depressed from 2016 onwards. I had just gotten out of a long-term relationship, family problems, financial stress as well as instability in my home country yada yada‚Ä¶ There was probably a period of around 10 months when I would be in bed 20+ hours a day, only leaving home once per week to shop. Weeks passed me by in an instant and I would have no recollection on what I did during the time. I constantly felt like I was too far gone to even bother with, and that I was a burden on everyone around me. I'm sure people with depression can relate.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, an old friend reached out to me and invited me over to his place to watch the new season of Always Sunny, which used to be our favorite show when we were flatmates back in school. I normally ghost everybody due to social anxiety and general lethargy but for some reason on that day, (thank god) I decided to go. Long story short, he made some pourover for me (which I had not tried until that point) that changed my perspective entirely on coffee. The flavors were intense and complex, and I was amazed at how it tasted almost like juice at the end as it cooled. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I got home that night, with some help from said friend, I ordered a V60 dripper, some filter papers, a coffee scale, a decanter, a gooseneck kettle and a Hario hand grinder. My first few cups were not great, but as I learned more and more about how different factors such as ground size and temperature influence extraction (thanks to youtube channels like James Hoffmann obviously), my mornings became something to look forward to. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I troubleshot every problem with my brew and came up with solutions, my confidence grew and I became more and more aware that I was capable of feeling passion about something still; I still wanted to improve at something. I realized that it had been so long since I even cared about anything outside of doing the bare minimum. This realization hit me like a ton of bricks. Not long after, I decided to finally call my parents and tell them everything about my depression, and I started seeing a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) and have been seeing the same doctor regularly since. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now, I still have rough days. However, I have cut down on smoking in order to taste better (still enjoy coffee with a cigarette though, just not smoking a pack a day anymore). I have also just upgraded to a Comandante C40 as an early birthday present to myself, and the difference it made in my brews was unbelievable and has made me even more excited about making coffee. I want to go thank my friend for introducing me to making coffee but I'm not sure if I want to tell him about my depression, might make him uncomfortable as we tend to stick to lighter topics.

I fully recognize the heretical and oxymoronic nature of this question (and I expect most of you clicked the thread to tell me so) but I find myself brewing drip coffee more than anything else just due to time constrains.  Over the weekend I use an aeropress, I use a pourover when I'm camping, and I've dabbled with a mocha pot, but most of the time it's just too convenient to grind some beans, dump grounds and water in the machine and hit the button.  I roast my own beans, so I do appreciate good coffee, but I usually wake up about 30 seconds before my first meeting of the day so more time consuming prep methods are out during the week.

So, my question:  What is the best drip coffee maker that money can buy?  Requirements as follows:

\-Not an espresso maker

\-Must have a single serve option.  Dual single serve/pot options are nice but not required.  I think I've used the pot option on my current drip machine about 4 times in 5 years.

\-Not a k-cup/pod style.  I roast my own beans so I'm not going to go buy sealed pods, and the plastic fillable/reuseable pods seem to give bland and inconsistent results.

Even still, I need to get a proper grinder. Currently using the flat bladed bean grinder attachment/cup that is on my bullet blender. Can get it fairly consistently coarse, but with more beans this becomes more difficult.

1935,Coffee,"Hello everyone. I have been dealing with reflux since last September, and my normal coffee has been affecting it since last November. I have tried several things (will detail below), but so far the only type of coffee that has definitely not caused any symptoms is the premade starbucks iced coffee that you buy in the refrigerator section of the grocery store near the milk. Here is a detailed list of what has bothered me and how much so it has. Note that I have historically been a simple coffee drinker, and what I have brewed at home was with an $8 walmart drip brewer with grounds bought at the grocery store.   


**Bothers me the most (symptoms last for up to over 24 hours):**  
Caribou Coffee Medium Roast ([Link](https://www.target.com/p/caribou-coffee-caribou-blend-medium-roast-ground-coffee-12oz/-/A-13379400#lnk=sametab))  
Caribou Coffee Mahogany Dark Roast ([link](https://www.target.com/p/caribou-coffee-mahogany-dark-roast-ground-coffee-12oz/-/A-13379396#lnk=sametab))

Caribou Coffee Decaf Medium Roast ([Link](https://www.target.com/p/caribou-coffee-caribou-blend-medium-roast-ground-coffee-decaf-12oz/-/A-13379394#lnk=sametab))

&amp;#x200B;

**Bothers me a decent amount (symptoms for a few hours):**  
Starbucks decaf bought in the cafe  


**Bothers me slightly sometimes:**  
Grocery store sold starbucks cold brew ([Link](https://www.target.com/p/starbucks-black-unsweetened-cold-brew-coffee-40-fl-oz/-/A-78295110#lnk=sametab))  


**Does not bother me at all:**  
Grocery store sold starbucks iced dark roast ([Link](https://www.target.com/p/starbucks-unsweetened-dark-roast-iced-coffee-48-fl-oz/-/A-15605613#lnk=sametab))  


  
**The symptoms caused by coffee:**  
Bloating  
Belching (including slight regurgitation in the worst cases near the start of it)  
Tasting acid  
Generally feeling bad  


If it helps, the main cause of my reflux seems to be Reflux Hypersensitivity, as PPI's did not remove my symptoms, but treating for reflux hypersensitivity seems to be slowly improving my symptoms.  


  
So at this point I am trying to figure out what about the above coffees that cause me issues is causing it, and to see if there are more types of coffee that I can drink without any issue besides the starbucks iced coffee. I don't know if its a specific type of bean or if it has something to do with the brewing processes. I don't believe it is caffeine itself (though I know it does affect some peoples reflux) since I can have the iced coffee without issue.  


Any advice anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated. I miss having hot coffee in the mornings. The Iced gets the job done, but I want than just that. I am willing to put some money into a good coffee maker, and even a good grinder if needed, if it allows me to have a good cup of coffee in the morning that doesn't upset my reflux.

I love coffee, I spend too much on it and right now, am trying to adjust to a more home economic setup. My problem is that I don't understand a thing about coffee except being able to enjoy it.

I've used home machines that have a basket which you tamper, but I'm now focusing on the Nespresso Vertuo series, as it's been the easiest method to get good tasting and consistent coffee without having to worry so much about weighing etc. For my situation, it has been perfect (I am no coffee, purist - so not trying to start a debate, just looking for advice).

Typically when I am out, I like to order a Flat White (Australian Coffee Term for basically a cappuccino - minus the froth and chocolate powder). I'd like to replicate this at home so a very consistent level, but I don't know what coffee to milk ratio is required.  


I've found that commercial grade machines, extract less water to coffee compared to the home appliance counterparts, which I find require more extraction to compensate for flavour. I don't know if this is true, I really don't understand the theory, I just drink the damn thing.

1988,Coffee,"I used to work downtown near many coffee shops that helped me get my fix. The good thing was that it was convenient, and it was always nice taking a walk to grab a coffee. The downsides were that I didn‚Äôt get the chance to appreciate the other aspects of coffee, such as the difference in beans and the preparation process.

That all changed when the pandemic forced everything to close down, and I had to shift to working from home. Since I could no longer get my fix from coffee shops, I had to drink the instant coffee I had at home. I could only take so much of the instant; this led me down the rabbit hole. 

To start, I picked up an Aeropress and some beans from local roasters near me after I browsed this sub and watched some YouTube videos. That eventually led to me picking up a Kalita Wave and trying out beans from roasters all over Canada. I subjectively rated each bean based on how much I enjoyed drinking it. I tasted the beans using the Kalita and Aeropress while dialling in different grind settings and brew temps and times. All of my thoughts are based on drinking these coffees black. No cream or sugar/sweeteners are added. 

Now to the point of the post. Even after trying all the different beans, I think I know which type of taste profile I enjoy, but it‚Äôs still tough to determine based on the information that roasters share on their sites. I‚Äôm hoping that if I list some of those details about the beans, such as origin, tasting notes, and a quick blurb of my thoughts on what I enjoyed, you all could help me identify some things I should keep an eye out for when I order new beans. 

I also get that I might be well off just sticking to ordering beans that list similar notes to the ones that I know I enjoy or keep ordering from the roasters I liked the most, but that‚Äôs no fun. Also, I‚Äôve excluded the names of the roasters from this list to avoid potentially breaking any rules related to promotion on the sub. Here goes:

|Blend - Brazil/Colombia (half-caf)|7|Cherry, Caramel, Dark Chocolate|This one had a strong aroma, but lacked a certain punch of flavour. |
|Kenya |9|Grape, White Nectarine|I enjoyed the notes of fruitiness in this coffee. Seemed like a lighter roast. |
|Ethiopia - Bensa|7|Blueberry, Strawberry Yogurt, White Peach |Fruity, but in a funky way as opposed to a sweet way. |
|Colombia - Popayan|8|Dark Chocolate, Papaya, Cacao|This one had a pronounced, almost bold, flavour to it. Not quite bitter, but what a coffee noob (like myself) would call 'dark'. |
|Brazil |8|Vanilla, Milk Chocolate, Cherry, Creamy|I did notice the light hints of chocolatey-ness. I could drink this every day too. |
|Costa Rica|8|Cinnamon, Fruit Cake, Rose|Similar type of funk to the beans from Bensa, Ethiopia. This was a bit more enjoyable, though. |
|Blend - Ethiopia/Brazil |8.5|Apricot, Cherry, Strawberry Cream|A mellow version of the funky Ethiopian beans. |
|Blend - Brazil/Colombia|8|Dark Chocolate, Hazelnut|This is what I would expect a dark roast from a cafe would taste like. |
|Colombia|9.5|Plum, Berries, Black Tea|This was my favourite one. I'd say the tasting note of berries is very accurate. |
|Brazil |9|Toffee, Creamy, Milk Chocolate|I feel like this one would be better described as Dark Chocolate instead of Milk. I loved the boldness. It was almost toasty. |
|Guatemala - Santa Cruz Barillas|9|Sugar Cookie, Butter Caramel, Almond|I didn't quite get the hints of cookies, but it was quite nutty. |
|Honduras|8.5|Walnuts, Dark Chocolate, Marzipan|Another mellow coffee. Only the slightest hints of chocolate. It was tough to notice right away. |
|Kenya - Kaliluni|8|Red Currant, Cherry, Cacao|I was hoping that this was going to taste like the sweet type of fruit from the previous Kenyan bean, but it was less pronounced. |
